## About This Project

Transform boring Unix/Linux manual pages into beautiful, readable documentation with enhanced formatting, better navigation, and modern styling.

## How It Works

We take traditional manual pages and make them sexy:

1. Steal a manual page using fip/fop
2. Format to enhanced markdown with our sexy formatter
3. Generate beautiful HTML with our static site generator

No more ugly, hard-to-navigate shell manuals!
