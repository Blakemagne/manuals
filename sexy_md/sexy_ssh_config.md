## Name {#name}

```
ssh_config — OpenSSH client configuration file
```



## Description {#description}

```
ssh(1)  obtains  configuration  data  from the following sources in the
following order:
```


             1.   command-line options
             2.   user's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
             3.   system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)

```
Unless noted otherwise, for each parameter, the  first  obtained  value
will  be  used.   The configuration files contain sections separated by
Host specifications, and that section is only applied  for  hosts  that
match one of the patterns given in the specification.  The matched host
name   is   usually  the  one  given  on  the  command  line  (see  the
CanonicalizeHostname option for exceptions).

Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used,  more  host-
specific  declarations  should be given near the beginning of the file,
and general defaults at the end.

Note that the Debian openssh-client package  sets  several  options  as
standard in /etc/ssh/ssh_config which are not the default in ssh(1):
```


             •   Include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*.conf
             •   SendEnv LANG LC_*
             •   HashKnownHosts yes
             •   GSSAPIAuthentication yes

```
/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*.conf  files  are  included  at the start of the
system-wide configuration file, so  options  set  there  will  override
those in /etc/ssh/ssh_config.

The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.  Lines starting
with  ‘#’  and  empty lines are interpreted as comments.  Arguments may
optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to represent argu‐
ments containing spaces.  Configuration options  may  be  separated  by
whitespace  or optional whitespace and exactly one ‘=’; the latter for‐
mat is useful to avoid the need to  quote  whitespace  when  specifying
configuration options using the ssh, scp, and sftp -o option.

The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that key‐
words are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):

Host    Restricts  the  following  declarations (up to the next Host or
        Match keyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the
        patterns given after the keyword.  If more than one pattern  is
        provided, they should be separated by whitespace.  A single ‘*’
        as  a  pattern  can  be used to provide global defaults for all
        hosts.  The host is usually the hostname argument given on  the
        command  line  (see the CanonicalizeHostname keyword for excep‐
        tions).

        A pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it with an exclama‐
        tion mark (‘!’).  If a negated entry is matched, then the  Host
        entry  is  ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on
        the line match.  Negated matches are therefore useful  to  pro‐
        vide exceptions for wildcard matches.

        See “PATTERNS” for more information on patterns.

Match   Restricts  the  following  declarations (up to the next Host or
        Match keyword) to be used only when  the  conditions  following
        the  Match  keyword are satisfied.  Match conditions are speci‐
        fied using one or more criteria or the single token  all  which
        always   matches.    The   available   criteria  keywords  are:
        canonical, final, exec, localnetwork, host, originalhost,  Tag,
        user, and localuser.  The all criteria must appear alone or im‐
        mediately after canonical or final.  Other criteria may be com‐
        bined  arbitrarily.  All criteria but all, canonical, and final
        require an argument.  Criteria may be negated by prepending  an
        exclamation mark (‘!’).

        The  canonical keyword matches only when the configuration file
        is being re-parsed after  hostname  canonicalization  (see  the
        CanonicalizeHostname  option).   This  may be useful to specify
        conditions that work with canonical host names only.

        The final keyword requests that the configuration be  re-parsed
        (regardless  of  whether  CanonicalizeHostname is enabled), and
        matches only during this final pass.   If  CanonicalizeHostname
        is  enabled,  then  canonical  and  final match during the same
        pass.

        The exec keyword  executes  the  specified  command  under  the
        user's  shell.   If the command returns a zero exit status then
        the condition is considered true.  Commands  containing  white‐
        space  characters must be quoted.  Arguments to exec accept the
        tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.

        The localnetwork keyword matches the addresses of active  local
        network  interfaces  against  the  supplied list of networks in
        CIDR format.  This may be convenient for varying the  effective
        configuration on devices that roam between networks.  Note that
        network  address  is  not a trustworthy criteria in many situa‐
        tions (e.g. when the network is automatically configured  using
        DHCP)  and  so caution should be applied if using it to control
        security-sensitive configuration.

        The other keywords' criteria must be single entries  or  comma-
        separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators
        described in the “PATTERNS” section.  The criteria for the host
        keyword are matched against the target hostname, after any sub‐
        stitution by the Hostname or CanonicalizeHostname options.  The
        originalhost  keyword  matches  against  the hostname as it was
        specified on the command-line.  The tagged  keyword  matches  a
        tag  name  specified  by a prior Tag directive or on the ssh(1)
        command-line using the  -P  flag.   The  user  keyword  matches
        against  the target username on the remote host.  The localuser
        keyword matches against the name  of  the  local  user  running
        ssh(1)  (this  keyword  may be useful in system-wide ssh_config
        files).

AddKeysToAgent
        Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a  run‐
        ning  ssh-agent(1).   If this option is set to yes and a key is
        loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to the
        agent with the default lifetime, as if by ssh-add(1).  If  this
        option  is  set  to ask, ssh(1) will require confirmation using
        the SSH_ASKPASS program before adding a key (see ssh-add(1) for
        details).  If this option is set to confirm, each  use  of  the
        key  must  be  confirmed,  as if the -c option was specified to
        ssh-add(1).  If this option is set to no, no keys are added  to
        the agent.  Alternately, this option may be specified as a time
        interval  using the format described in the “TIME FORMATS” sec‐
        tion  of  sshd_config(5)  to  specify  the  key's  lifetime  in
        ssh-agent(1),  after  which  it  will automatically be removed.
        The argument must be no (the default), yes, confirm (optionally
        followed by a time interval), ask or a time interval.

AddressFamily
        Specifies which address family to use when  connecting.   Valid
        arguments are any (the default), inet (use IPv4 only), or inet6
        (use IPv6 only).

BatchMode
        If  set  to  yes, user interaction such as password prompts and
        host key confirmation requests will be disabled.  In  addition,
        the  ServerAliveInterval  option  will be set to 300 seconds by
        default (Debian-specific).  This option is  useful  in  scripts
        and  other batch jobs where no user is present to interact with
        ssh(1), and where it is desirable to detect  a  broken  network
        swiftly.  The argument must be yes or no (the default).

BindAddress
        Use  the  specified  address on the local machine as the source
        address of the connection.  Only useful on  systems  with  more
        than one address.

BindInterface
        Use the address of the specified interface on the local machine
        as the source address of the connection.

CanonicalDomains
        When CanonicalizeHostname is enabled, this option specifies the
        list  of  domain  suffixes in which to search for the specified
        destination host.

CanonicalizeFallbackLocal
        Specifies whether to fail with an error when  hostname  canoni‐
        calization  fails.   The  default, yes, will attempt to look up
        the unqualified hostname using  the  system  resolver's  search
        rules.   A  value  of no will cause ssh(1) to fail instantly if
        CanonicalizeHostname is enabled and the target hostname  cannot
        be found in any of the domains specified by CanonicalDomains.

CanonicalizeHostname
        Controls  whether  explicit  hostname  canonicalization is per‐
        formed.  The default, no, is not to perform any name  rewriting
        and  let  the  system resolver handle all hostname lookups.  If
        set to yes then, for connections that do not use a ProxyCommand
        or ProxyJump, ssh(1) will attempt to canonicalize the  hostname
        specified  on  the command line using the CanonicalDomains suf‐
        fixes    and     CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs     rules.      If
        CanonicalizeHostname is set to always, then canonicalization is
        applied to proxied connections too.

        If  this  option  is  enabled, then the configuration files are
        processed again using the new target name to pick  up  any  new
        configuration  in  matching Host and Match stanzas.  A value of
        none disables the use of a ProxyJump host.

CanonicalizeMaxDots
        Specifies the maximum number of dot characters  in  a  hostname
        before  canonicalization is disabled.  The default, 1, allows a
        single dot (i.e. hostname.subdomain).

CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
        Specifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be  followed
        when  canonicalizing  hostnames.   The  rules consist of one or
        more arguments of source_domain_list:target_domain_list,  where
        source_domain_list is a pattern-list of domains that may follow
        CNAMEs  in  canonicalization,  and target_domain_list is a pat‐
        tern-list of domains that they may resolve to.

        For example,  "*.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com"
        will  allow  hostnames matching "*.a.example.com" to be canoni‐
        calized to names in the "*.b.example.com" or  "*.c.example.com"
        domains.

        A  single  argument of "none" causes no CNAMEs to be considered
        for canonicalization.  This is the default behaviour.

CASignatureAlgorithms
        Specifies which algorithms are allowed for signing of  certifi‐
        cates by certificate authorities (CAs).  The default is:

              ssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
              ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
              sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,
              sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,
              rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256

        If  the  specified  list  begins with a ‘+’ character, then the
        specified algorithms will be appended to the  default  set  in‐
        stead  of  replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a
        ‘-’ character, then the specified algorithms  (including  wild‐
        cards)  will be removed from the default set instead of replac‐
        ing them.

        ssh(1) will not accept host  certificates  signed  using  algo‐
        rithms other than those specified.

CertificateFile
        Specifies  a file from which the user's certificate is read.  A
        corresponding private key must be provided separately in  order
        to  use  this certificate either from an IdentityFile directive
        or -i flag to ssh(1), via ssh-agent(1), or via a PKCS11Provider
        or SecurityKeyProvider.

        Arguments to CertificateFile may use the tilde syntax to  refer
        to  a  user's  home  directory,  the  tokens  described  in the
        “TOKENS” section and environment variables as described in  the
        “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

        It  is possible to have multiple certificate files specified in
        configuration files; these certificates will be  tried  in  se‐
        quence.   Multiple  CertificateFile  directives will add to the
        list of certificates used for authentication.

ChannelTimeout
        Specifies whether and how quickly ssh(1) should close  inactive
        channels.     Timeouts   are   specified   as   one   or   more
        “type=interval” pairs separated by whitespace, where the “type”
        must be a channel type name (as described in the table  below),
        optionally containing wildcard characters.

        The timeout value “interval” is specified in seconds or may use
        any of the units documented in the “TIME FORMATS” section.  For
        example,  “session=5m”  would  cause the interactive session to
        terminate after five minutes of inactivity.  Specifying a  zero
        value disables the inactivity timeout.

        The available channel types include:

        agent-connection
                Open connections to ssh-agent(1).

        direct-tcpip, direct-streamlocal@openssh.com
                Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that
                have  been  established from a ssh(1) local forwarding,
                i.e. LocalForward or DynamicForward.

        forwarded-tcpip, forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com
                Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that
                have been established to a sshd(8) listening on  behalf
                of a ssh(1) remote forwarding, i.e. RemoteForward.

        session
                The  interactive main session, including shell session,
                command execution, scp(1), sftp(1), etc.

        tun-connection
                Open TunnelForward connections.

        x11-connection
                Open X11 forwarding sessions.

        Note that in all the above cases, terminating an inactive  ses‐
        sion does not guarantee to remove all resources associated with
        the  session,  e.g.  shell processes or X11 clients relating to
        the session may continue to execute.

        Moreover, terminating an inactive channel or session  does  not
        necessarily  close  the  SSH  connection, nor does it prevent a
        client from requesting another channel of the  same  type.   In
        particular,  expiring  an  inactive forwarding session does not
        prevent another identical forwarding  from  being  subsequently
        created.

        The  default is not to expire channels of any type for inactiv‐
        ity.

CheckHostIP
        If set to yes, ssh(1) will additionally check the host  IP  ad‐
        dress  in  the known_hosts file.  This allows it to detect if a
        host key changed due to DNS spoofing and will add addresses  of
        destination hosts to ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the process, regard‐
        less of the setting of StrictHostKeyChecking.  If the option is
        set to no (the default), the check will not be executed.

Ciphers
        Specifies  the  ciphers  allowed and their order of preference.
        Multiple ciphers must be  comma-separated.   If  the  specified
        list  begins  with  a ‘+’ character, then the specified ciphers
        will be appended to the default set instead of replacing  them.
        If  the  specified  list  begins with a ‘-’ character, then the
        specified ciphers (including wildcards) will  be  removed  from
        the  default  set  instead of replacing them.  If the specified
        list begins with a ‘^’ character, then  the  specified  ciphers
        will be placed at the head of the default set.

        The supported ciphers are:

              3des-cbc
              aes128-cbc
              aes192-cbc
              aes256-cbc
              aes128-ctr
              aes192-ctr
              aes256-ctr
              aes128-gcm@openssh.com
              aes256-gcm@openssh.com
              chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

        The default is:

              chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,
              aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,
              aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com

        The  list  of available ciphers may also be obtained using "ssh
        -Q cipher".

ClearAllForwardings
        Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port  forwardings
        specified  in the configuration files or on the command line be
        cleared.  This option is primarily useful when  used  from  the
        ssh(1) command line to clear port forwardings set in configura‐
        tion  files,  and  is  automatically set by scp(1) and sftp(1).
        The argument must be yes or no (the default).

Compression
        Specifies whether to use compression.  The argument must be yes
        or no (the default).

ConnectionAttempts
        Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to  make  before
        exiting.   The argument must be an integer.  This may be useful
        in scripts if the connection sometimes fails.  The  default  is
        1.

ConnectTimeout
        Specifies  the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the
        SSH server, instead of using the default  system  TCP  timeout.
        This timeout is applied both to establishing the connection and
        to  performing  the  initial SSH protocol handshake and key ex‐
        change.

ControlMaster
        Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single  network
        connection.   When  set  to yes, ssh(1) will listen for connec‐
        tions on a control socket specified using the ControlPath argu‐
        ment.  Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the
        same ControlPath with ControlMaster set to  no  (the  default).
        These  sessions will try to reuse the master instance's network
        connection rather than initiating new ones, but will fall  back
        to connecting normally if the control socket does not exist, or
        is not listening.

        Setting  this  to  ask  will cause ssh(1) to listen for control
        connections, but require confirmation using ssh-askpass(1).  If
        the ControlPath cannot be opened, ssh(1) will continue  without
        connecting to a master instance.

        X11  and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported over these multi‐
        plexed connections, however the  display  and  agent  forwarded
        will  be  the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is
        not possible to forward multiple displays or agents.

        Two additional options allow  for  opportunistic  multiplexing:
        try  to use a master connection but fall back to creating a new
        one if one does not already exist.  These options are: auto and
        autoask.  The latter requires confirmation like the ask option.

ControlPath
        Specify the path to the  control  socket  used  for  connection
        sharing  as described in the ControlMaster section above or the
        string  none  to  disable  connection  sharing.   Arguments  to
        ControlPath  may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home
        directory, the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section and en‐
        vironment variables as described in the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES”
        section.  It is recommended that any ControlPath used  for  op‐
        portunistic  connection sharing include at least %h, %p, and %r
        (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a directory that is  not
        writable  by other users.  This ensures that shared connections
        are uniquely identified.

ControlPersist
        When used in conjunction with ControlMaster, specifies that the
        master connection should remain open in the background (waiting
        for future client connections) after the initial client connec‐
        tion has been closed.  If set to no  (the  default),  then  the
        master  connection  will not be placed into the background, and
        will close as soon as the initial client connection is  closed.
        If  set  to yes or 0, then the master connection will remain in
        the background indefinitely (until killed or closed via a mech‐
        anism such as the "ssh -O exit").  If set to a time in seconds,
        or a time in any of the formats documented  in  sshd_config(5),
        then the backgrounded master connection will automatically ter‐
        minate  after it has remained idle (with no client connections)
        for the specified time.

DynamicForward
        Specifies that a TCP port on the  local  machine  be  forwarded
        over  the  secure channel, and the application protocol is then
        used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

        The argument must be [bind_address:]port.  IPv6  addresses  can
        be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  By de‐
        fault,   the  local  port  is  bound  in  accordance  with  the
        GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be
        used to  bind  the  connection  to  a  specific  address.   The
        bind_address  of localhost indicates that the listening port be
        bound for local use only, while an empty address or  ‘*’  indi‐
        cates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

        Currently  the  SOCKS4  and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and
        ssh(1) will act as a SOCKS server.  Multiple forwardings may be
        specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the  com‐
        mand line.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.

EnableEscapeCommandline
        Enables  the command line option in the EscapeChar menu for in‐
        teractive sessions (default ‘~C’).   By  default,  the  command
        line is disabled.

EnableSSHKeysign
        Setting  this  option to yes in the global client configuration
        file /etc/ssh/ssh_config enables the use of the helper  program
        ssh-keysign(8)  during  HostbasedAuthentication.   The argument
        must be yes or no (the default).  This option should be  placed
        in  the  non-hostspecific section.  See ssh-keysign(8) for more
        information.

EscapeChar
        Sets the escape character (default: ‘~’).  The escape character
        can also be set on the command line.  The argument should be  a
        single  character, ‘^’ followed by a letter, or none to disable
        the escape character entirely (making the connection  transpar‐
        ent for binary data).

ExitOnForwardFailure
        Specifies  whether ssh(1) should terminate the connection if it
        cannot set up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and  remote
        port  forwardings,  (e.g.  if  either end is unable to bind and
        listen on a specified port).   Note  that  ExitOnForwardFailure
        does  not  apply  to connections made over port forwardings and
        will not, for example, cause ssh(1) to exit if TCP  connections
        to the ultimate forwarding destination fail.  The argument must
        be yes or no (the default).

FingerprintHash
        Specifies  the  hash algorithm used when displaying key finger‐
        prints.  Valid options are: md5 and sha256 (the default).

ForkAfterAuthentication
        Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
        This is useful  if  ssh  is  going  to  ask  for  passwords  or
        passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This im‐
        plies  the  StdinNull  configuration option being set to “yes”.
        The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote  site  is
        with something like ssh -f host xterm, which is the same as ssh
        host  xterm if the ForkAfterAuthentication configuration option
        is set to “yes”.

        If the ExitOnForwardFailure  configuration  option  is  set  to
        “yes”,  then  a client started with the ForkAfterAuthentication
        configuration option being set to “yes” will wait for  all  re‐
        mote  port forwards to be successfully established before plac‐
        ing itself in the background.  The  argument  to  this  keyword
        must be yes (same as the -f option) or no (the default).

ForwardAgent
        Specifies  whether  the  connection to the authentication agent
        (if any) will be forwarded to the remote machine.  The argument
        may be yes, no (the default), an  explicit  path  to  an  agent
        socket  or  the name of an environment variable (beginning with
        ‘$’) in which to find the path.

        Agent forwarding should be enabled with  caution.   Users  with
        the  ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for
        the agent's Unix-domain socket)  can  access  the  local  agent
        through  the  forwarded  connection.  An attacker cannot obtain
        key material from the agent, however they  can  perform  opera‐
        tions  on  the  keys that enable them to authenticate using the
        identities loaded into the agent.

ForwardX11
        Specifies whether X11 connections will be  automatically  redi‐
        rected  over  the secure channel and DISPLAY set.  The argument
        must be yes or no (the default).

        X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with  the
        ability  to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
        user's X11 authorization database) can  access  the  local  X11
        display through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then
        be  able  to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if
        the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.

ForwardX11Timeout
        Specify a timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding using the format
        described in the “TIME FORMATS” section of sshd_config(5).  X11
        connections received by ssh(1) after this time will be refused.
        Setting ForwardX11Timeout to zero will disable the timeout  and
        permit  X11 forwarding for the life of the connection.  The de‐
        fault is to disable untrusted X11 forwarding after twenty  min‐
        utes has elapsed.

ForwardX11Trusted
        If  this  option  is set to yes, (the Debian-specific default),
        remote X11 clients will have full access to  the  original  X11
        display.

        If  this option is set to no (the upstream default), remote X11
        clients will be considered untrusted and prevented from  steal‐
        ing  or  tampering  with data belonging to trusted X11 clients.
        Furthermore, the xauth(1) token used for the  session  will  be
        set to expire after 20 minutes.  Remote clients will be refused
        access after this time.

        See  the  X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details
        on the restrictions imposed on untrusted clients.

GatewayPorts
        Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to  local
        forwarded  ports.  By default, ssh(1) binds local port forward‐
        ings to the loopback address.  This prevents other remote hosts
        from connecting to forwarded ports.  GatewayPorts can  be  used
        to  specify  that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the
        wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to for‐
        warded ports.  The argument must be yes or no (the default).

GlobalKnownHostsFile
        Specifies one or more files to use  for  the  global  host  key
        database,    separated   by   whitespace.    The   default   is
        /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2.

GSSAPIAuthentication
        Specifies whether user authentication based on  GSSAPI  is  al‐
        lowed.  The default is no.

GSSAPIClientIdentity
        If  set,  specifies  the GSSAPI client identity that ssh should
        use when connecting to the server. The default is unset,  which
        means that the default identity will be used.

GSSAPIDelegateCredentials
        Forward  (delegate)  credentials to the server.  The default is
        no.

GSSAPIKeyExchange
        Specifies whether key exchange based on  GSSAPI  may  be  used.
        When  using GSSAPI key exchange the server need not have a host
        key.  The default is “no”.

GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey
        If set to “yes” then renewal of the client's GSSAPI credentials
        will force the rekeying of the ssh connection. With a  compati‐
        ble  server,  this  will  delegate the renewed credentials to a
        session on the server.

        Checks are made to ensure that credentials are only  propagated
        when  the new credentials match the old ones on the originating
        client and where the receiving server still has the old set  in
        its cache.

        The default is “no”.

        For  this  to work GSSAPIKeyExchange needs to be enabled in the
        server and also used by the client.

GSSAPIServerIdentity
        If set, specifies the GSSAPI server identity  that  ssh  should
        expect  when  connecting  to  the server. The default is unset,
        which means that the expected GSSAPI server  identity  will  be
        determined from the target hostname.

GSSAPITrustDns
        Set  to  “yes”  to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely
        canonicalize the name of the host being connected to. If  “no”,
        the  hostname  entered  on  the command line will be passed un‐
        touched to the GSSAPI library.  The default is “no”.

GSSAPIKexAlgorithms
        The list of key exchange algorithms that are offered for GSSAPI
        key exchange. Possible values are

           gss-gex-sha1-,
           gss-group1-sha1-,
           gss-group14-sha1-,
           gss-group14-sha256-,
           gss-group16-sha512-,
           gss-nistp256-sha256-,
           gss-curve25519-sha256-

        The                         default                          is
        “gss-group14-sha256-,gss-group16-sha512-,gss-nistp256-sha256-,gss-curve25519-sha256-,gss-gex-sha1-,gss-group14-sha1-”.
        This option only applies to connections using GSSAPI.

HashKnownHosts
        Indicates that ssh(1) should hash host names and addresses when
        they  are  added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  These hashed names may
        be used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they do  not  visu‐
        ally  reveal identifying information if the file's contents are
        disclosed.  The default is no.  Note that  existing  names  and
        addresses  in known hosts files will not be converted automati‐
        cally, but may be manually hashed using ssh-keygen(1).  Use  of
        this  option  may  break facilities such as tab-completion that
        rely  on  being  able  to  read  unhashed   host   names   from
        ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms
        Specifies  the signature algorithms that will be used for host‐
        based authentication as a  comma-separated  list  of  patterns.
        Alternately  if the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character,
        then the specified signature algorithms will be appended to the
        default set instead of replacing them.  If the  specified  list
        begins with a ‘-’ character, then the specified signature algo‐
        rithms  (including  wildcards) will be removed from the default
        set instead of replacing them.  If the  specified  list  begins
        with  a  ‘^’ character, then the specified signature algorithms
        will be placed at the head of the default set.  The default for
        this option is:

           ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ssh-ed25519,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
           sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,
           sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256

        The -Q option of ssh(1) may be used to list supported signature
        algorithms.  This was formerly named HostbasedKeyTypes.

HostbasedAuthentication
        Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with  pub‐
        lic  key  authentication.   The argument must be yes or no (the
        default).

HostKeyAlgorithms
        Specifies the host key signature  algorithms  that  the  client
        wants to use in order of preference.  Alternately if the speci‐
        fied  list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified sig‐
        nature algorithms will be appended to the default  set  instead
        of  replacing  them.   If  the specified list begins with a ‘-’
        character, then the specified signature  algorithms  (including
        wildcards)  will be removed from the default set instead of re‐
        placing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘^’  charac‐
        ter,  then the specified signature algorithms will be placed at
        the head of the default set.  The default for this option is:

           ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ssh-ed25519,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
           sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,
           sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256

        If hostkeys are known for the destination host  then  this  de‐
        fault is modified to prefer their algorithms.

        The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained
        using "ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms".

HostKeyAlias
        Specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host
        name  when  looking  up  or saving the host key in the host key
        database files and when validating host certificates.  This op‐
        tion is useful for tunneling SSH connections  or  for  multiple
        servers running on a single host.

Hostname
        Specifies  the real host name to log into.  This can be used to
        specify nicknames or abbreviations  for  hosts.   Arguments  to
        Hostname  accept  the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.
        Numeric IP addresses are also permitted (both  on  the  command
        line  and in Hostname specifications).  The default is the name
        given on the command line.

IdentitiesOnly
        Specifies that ssh(1) should only use the configured  authenti‐
        cation  identity  and  certificate  files  (either  the default
        files, or those explicitly configured in the  ssh_config  files
        or  passed on the ssh(1) command-line), even if ssh-agent(1) or
        a PKCS11Provider or SecurityKeyProvider offers more identities.
        The argument to this keyword must be yes or no  (the  default).
        This  option  is intended for situations where ssh-agent offers
        many different identities.

IdentityAgent
        Specifies the Unix-domain socket used to communicate  with  the
        authentication agent.

        This  option  overrides  the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable
        and can be used to select a specific agent.  Setting the socket
        name to none disables the use of an authentication  agent.   If
        the  string  "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"  is specified, the location of the
        socket will be read from the  SSH_AUTH_SOCK  environment  vari‐
        able.  Otherwise if the specified value begins with a ‘$’ char‐
        acter,  then it will be treated as an environment variable con‐
        taining the location of the socket.

        Arguments to IdentityAgent may use the tilde syntax to refer to
        a user's home directory, the tokens described in  the  “TOKENS”
        section   and   environment   variables  as  described  in  the
        “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

IdentityFile
        Specifies a file from which the user's DSA, ECDSA,  authentica‐
        tor-hosted  ECDSA, Ed25519, authenticator-hosted Ed25519 or RSA
        authentication identity is read.  You can also specify a public
        key file to use the corresponding private key that is loaded in
        ssh-agent(1) when the private key file is not present  locally.
        The      default     is     ~/.ssh/id_rsa,     ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
        ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk and
        ~/.ssh/id_dsa.  Additionally, any identities represented by the
        authentication agent will be  used  for  authentication  unless
        IdentitiesOnly is set.  If no certificates have been explicitly
        specified  by CertificateFile, ssh(1) will try to load certifi‐
        cate  information  from  the  filename  obtained  by  appending
        -cert.pub to the path of a specified IdentityFile.

        Arguments  to IdentityFile may use the tilde syntax to refer to
        a user's home directory or the tokens described in the “TOKENS”
        section.  Alternately an argument of none may be used to  indi‐
        cate no identity files should be loaded.

        It  is  possible  to  have multiple identity files specified in
        configuration files; all these identities will be tried in  se‐
        quence.   Multiple IdentityFile directives will add to the list
        of identities tried (this behaviour differs from that of  other
        configuration directives).

        IdentityFile  may be used in conjunction with IdentitiesOnly to
        select which identities in an agent are offered during  authen‐
        tication.   IdentityFile  may  also be used in conjunction with
        CertificateFile in order to provide any certificate also needed
        for authentication with the identity.

IgnoreUnknown
        Specifies a pattern-list of unknown options to  be  ignored  if
        they  are  encountered  in  configuration parsing.  This may be
        used to suppress errors if ssh_config contains options that are
        unrecognised by ssh(1).  It is recommended  that  IgnoreUnknown
        be listed early in the configuration file as it will not be ap‐
        plied to unknown options that appear before it.

Include
        Include  the  specified  configuration file(s).  Multiple path‐
        names may be specified and each pathname  may  contain  glob(7)
        wildcards  and,  for user configurations, shell-like ‘~’ refer‐
        ences to user home directories.  Wildcards will be expanded and
        processed in lexical order.  Files without absolute  paths  are
        assumed  to  be  in  ~/.ssh if included in a user configuration
        file or /etc/ssh if  included  from  the  system  configuration
        file.   Include  directive  may  appear  inside a Match or Host
        block to perform conditional inclusion.

IPQoS   Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP  class  for  connec‐
        tions.  Accepted values are af11, af12, af13, af21, af22, af23,
        af31,  af32,  af33,  af41, af42, af43, cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3, cs4,
        cs5, cs6, cs7, ef, le, lowdelay, throughput, reliability, a nu‐
        meric value, or none to use the operating system default.  This
        option may take one or two arguments, separated by  whitespace.
        If  one  argument  is specified, it is used as the packet class
        unconditionally.  If two values are specified, the first is au‐
        tomatically selected for interactive sessions  and  the  second
        for  non-interactive sessions.  The default is lowdelay for in‐
        teractive sessions and throughput for non-interactive sessions.

KbdInteractiveAuthentication
        Specifies whether to use  keyboard-interactive  authentication.
        The  argument  to this keyword must be yes (the default) or no.
        ChallengeResponseAuthentication is a deprecated alias for this.

KbdInteractiveDevices
        Specifies the list of methods to  use  in  keyboard-interactive
        authentication.  Multiple method names must be comma-separated.
        The  default  is to use the server specified list.  The methods
        available vary depending on what the server supports.   For  an
        OpenSSH server, it may be zero or more of: bsdauth and pam.

KexAlgorithms
        Specifies  the available KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms.  Multi‐
        ple algorithms must be comma-separated.  If the specified  list
        begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will
        be  appended  to the default set instead of replacing them.  If
        the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character, then the speci‐
        fied algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from  the
        default  set  instead of replacing them.  If the specified list
        begins with a ‘^’ character, then the specified algorithms will
        be placed at the head of the default set.  The default is:

              sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com,
              curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,
              ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,
              diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,
              diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,
              diffie-hellman-group18-sha512,
              diffie-hellman-group14-sha256

        The list of available key exchange algorithms may also  be  ob‐
        tained using "ssh -Q kex".

KnownHostsCommand
        Specifies  a  command  to use to obtain a list of host keys, in
        addition   to   those   listed   in   UserKnownHostsFile    and
        GlobalKnownHostsFile.  This command is executed after the files
        have been read.  It may write host key lines to standard output
        in  identical  format  to  the  usual  files  (described in the
        “VERIFYING  HOST  KEYS”  section  in  ssh(1)).   Arguments   to
        KnownHostsCommand  accept  the tokens described in the “TOKENS”
        section.  The command may be invoked multiple times per connec‐
        tion: once when preparing the preference list of host key algo‐
        rithms to use, again to obtain the host key for  the  requested
        host  name and, if CheckHostIP is enabled, one more time to ob‐
        tain the host key matching the server's address.  If  the  com‐
        mand  exits  abnormally  or returns a non-zero exit status then
        the connection is terminated.

LocalCommand
        Specifies a command to execute on the local machine after  suc‐
        cessfully connecting to the server.  The command string extends
        to  the end of the line, and is executed with the user's shell.
        Arguments to LocalCommand accept the tokens  described  in  the
        “TOKENS” section.

        The  command  is  run synchronously and does not have access to
        the session of the ssh(1) that spawned it.  It  should  not  be
        used for interactive commands.

        This  directive  is  ignored unless PermitLocalCommand has been
        enabled.

LocalForward
        Specifies that a TCP port on the  local  machine  be  forwarded
        over the secure channel to the specified host and port from the
        remote  machine.  The first argument specifies the listener and
        may be [bind_address:]port or a Unix domain socket  path.   The
        second  argument is the destination and may be host:hostport or
        a Unix domain socket path if the remote host supports it.

        IPv6 addresses can  be  specified  by  enclosing  addresses  in
        square  brackets.   Multiple  forwardings may be specified, and
        additional forwardings can be given on the command line.   Only
        the  superuser  can  forward privileged ports.  By default, the
        local port is bound in accordance with  the  GatewayPorts  set‐
        ting.   However,  an  explicit bind_address may be used to bind
        the connection to a  specific  address.   The  bind_address  of
        localhost  indicates that the listening port be bound for local
        use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port
        should be available from all interfaces.   Unix  domain  socket
        paths  may use the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section and
        environment  variables  as  described   in   the   “ENVIRONMENT
        VARIABLES” section.

LogLevel
        Gives  the  verbosity  level that is used when logging messages
        from ssh(1).  The possible values  are:  QUIET,  FATAL,  ERROR,
        INFO,  VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default
        is INFO.  DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2  and  DEBUG3
        each specify higher levels of verbose output.

LogVerbose
        Specify  one  or  more overrides to LogLevel.  An override con‐
        sists of a pattern lists that matches the source file, function
        and line number to force detailed logging for.  For example, an
        override pattern of:

              kex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*,packet.c:*

        would enable detailed logging for line 1000  of  kex.c,  every‐
        thing  in  the  kex_exchange_identification() function, and all
        code in the packet.c file.  This option is intended for  debug‐
        ging and no overrides are enabled by default.

MACs    Specifies  the  MAC (message authentication code) algorithms in
        order of preference.  The MAC algorithm is used  for  data  in‐
        tegrity  protection.   Multiple  algorithms must be comma-sepa‐
        rated.  If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then
        the specified algorithms will be appended to  the  default  set
        instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a
        ‘-’  character,  then the specified algorithms (including wild‐
        cards) will be removed from the default set instead of  replac‐
        ing  them.   If the specified list begins with a ‘^’ character,
        then the specified algorithms will be placed at the head of the
        default set.

        The algorithms that contain "-etm" calculate the MAC after  en‐
        cryption  (encrypt-then-mac).   These  are considered safer and
        their use recommended.

        The default is:

              umac-64-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,
              hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,
              hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com,
              umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,
              hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1

        The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using
        "ssh -Q mac".

NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost
        Disable host authentication for localhost (loopback addresses).
        The argument to this keyword must be yes or no (the default).

NumberOfPasswordPrompts
        Specifies the number of password prompts before giving up.  The
        argument to this keyword must be an integer.  The default is 3.

ObscureKeystrokeTiming
        Specifies whether ssh(1) should try to obscure  inter-keystroke
        timings from passive observers of network traffic.  If enabled,
        then  for  interactive sessions, ssh(1) will send keystrokes at
        fixed intervals of a few tens of  milliseconds  and  will  send
        fake  keystroke packets for some time after typing ceases.  The
        argument to this keyword must be yes, no or an interval  speci‐
        fier of the form interval:milliseconds (e.g. interval:80 for 80
        milliseconds).   The  default  is to obscure keystrokes using a
        20ms packet interval.  Note that smaller intervals will  result
        in higher fake keystroke packet rates.

PasswordAuthentication
        Specifies whether to use password authentication.  The argument
        to this keyword must be yes (the default) or no.

PermitLocalCommand
        Allow  local  command  execution via the LocalCommand option or
        using the !command escape sequence  in  ssh(1).   The  argument
        must be yes or no (the default).

PermitRemoteOpen
        Specifies  the destinations to which remote TCP port forwarding
        is permitted when RemoteForward is used as a SOCKS proxy.   The
        forwarding specification must be one of the following forms:

              PermitRemoteOpen host:port
              PermitRemoteOpen IPv4_addr:port
              PermitRemoteOpen [IPv6_addr]:port

        Multiple  forwards  may  be  specified  by separating them with
        whitespace.  An argument of any can be used to remove  all  re‐
        strictions  and permit any forwarding requests.  An argument of
        none can be used to  prohibit  all  forwarding  requests.   The
        wildcard ‘*’ can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or
        ports  respectively.  Otherwise, no pattern matching or address
        lookups are performed on supplied names.

PKCS11Provider
        Specifies which PKCS#11 provider to use  or  none  to  indicate
        that no provider should be used (the default).  The argument to
        this  keyword  is  a  path to the PKCS#11 shared library ssh(1)
        should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token  providing  keys
        for user authentication.

Port    Specifies  the  port number to connect on the remote host.  The
        default is 22.

PreferredAuthentications
        Specifies the order in which the client should try  authentica‐
        tion  methods.  This allows a client to prefer one method (e.g.
        keyboard-interactive) over another method (e.g. password).  The
        default is:

              gssapi-with-mic,hostbased,publickey,
              keyboard-interactive,password

ProxyCommand
        Specifies the command to use to connect  to  the  server.   The
        command  string extends to the end of the line, and is executed
        using the user's shell ‘exec’ directive to  avoid  a  lingering
        shell process.

        Arguments  to  ProxyCommand  accept the tokens described in the
        “TOKENS” section.  The command can be basically  anything,  and
        should  read  from its standard input and write to its standard
        output.  It should eventually connect an sshd(8) server running
        on some machine, or execute sshd -i somewhere.  Host  key  man‐
        agement  will be done using the Hostname of the host being con‐
        nected (defaulting to the name typed by the user).  Setting the
        command to none  disables  this  option  entirely.   Note  that
        CheckHostIP is not available for connects with a proxy command.

        This  directive  is  useful  in  conjunction with nc(1) and its
        proxy support.  For example, the following directive would con‐
        nect via an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:

           ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p

ProxyJump
        Specifies one or more jump proxies as either [user@]host[:port]
        or an ssh URI.  Multiple proxies  may  be  separated  by  comma
        characters  and will be visited sequentially.  Setting this op‐
        tion will cause ssh(1) to connect to the target host  by  first
        making  a ssh(1) connection to the specified ProxyJump host and
        then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate target  from
        there.  Setting the host to none disables this option entirely.

        Note that this option will compete with the ProxyCommand option
        -  whichever is specified first will prevent later instances of
        the other from taking effect.

        Note also that the configuration for the destination host  (ei‐
        ther  supplied  via the command-line or the configuration file)
        is not generally applied to jump hosts.   ~/.ssh/config  should
        be used if specific configuration is required for jump hosts.

ProxyUseFdpass
        Specifies that ProxyCommand will pass a connected file descrip‐
        tor  back  to  ssh(1) instead of continuing to execute and pass
        data.  The default is no.

PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms
        Specifies the signature algorithms that will be used for public
        key authentication as a comma-separated list of  patterns.   If
        the  specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the algo‐
        rithms after it will be appended to the default instead of  re‐
        placing it.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,
        then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be re‐
        moved  from  the default set instead of replacing them.  If the
        specified list begins with a ‘^’ character, then the  specified
        algorithms  will be placed at the head of the default set.  The
        default for this option is:

           ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
           ssh-ed25519,
           ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
           sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,
           sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,
           rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256

        The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained
        using "ssh -Q PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms".

PubkeyAuthentication
        Specifies whether to try public key authentication.  The  argu‐
        ment  to this keyword must be yes (the default), no, unbound or
        host-bound.  The final two options enable public key  authenti‐
        cation  while  respectively  disabling  or enabling the OpenSSH
        host-bound authentication protocol extension required  for  re‐
        stricted ssh-agent(1) forwarding.

RekeyLimit
        Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted or
        received  before  the  session  key is renegotiated, optionally
        followed by a maximum amount of time that may pass  before  the
        session  key  is renegotiated.  The first argument is specified
        in bytes and may have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’, or ‘G’ to  indicate
        Kilobytes,  Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  The default
        is between ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending on  the  cipher.   The  op‐
        tional  second value is specified in seconds and may use any of
        the  units  documented  in  the   TIME   FORMATS   section   of
        sshd_config(5).   The  default  value for RekeyLimit is default
        none, which means that rekeying is performed after the cipher's
        default amount of data has been sent or received  and  no  time
        based rekeying is done.

RemoteCommand
        Specifies a command to execute on the remote machine after suc‐
        cessfully connecting to the server.  The command string extends
        to  the end of the line, and is executed with the user's shell.
        Arguments to RemoteCommand accept the tokens described  in  the
        “TOKENS” section.

RemoteForward
        Specifies  that  a  TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded
        over the secure channel.  The remote port may  either  be  for‐
        warded  to a specified host and port from the local machine, or
        may act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy that allows  a  remote  client  to
        connect  to arbitrary destinations from the local machine.  The
        first argument  is  the  listening  specification  and  may  be
        [bind_address:]port  or, if the remote host supports it, a Unix
        domain socket path.  If forwarding to  a  specific  destination
        then the second argument must be host:hostport or a Unix domain
        socket  path, otherwise if no destination argument is specified
        then the remote forwarding  will  be  established  as  a  SOCKS
        proxy.   When  acting  as a SOCKS proxy, the destination of the
        connection can be restricted by PermitRemoteOpen.

        IPv6 addresses can  be  specified  by  enclosing  addresses  in
        square  brackets.   Multiple  forwardings may be specified, and
        additional forwardings can be given on the command line.  Priv‐
        ileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as  root  on
        the  remote  machine.  Unix domain socket paths may use the to‐
        kens described in the “TOKENS” section  and  environment  vari‐
        ables as described in the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

        If  the port argument is 0, the listen port will be dynamically
        allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.

        If the bind_address is not specified, the default  is  to  only
        bind  to  loopback addresses.  If the bind_address is ‘*’ or an
        empty string, then the forwarding is requested to listen on all
        interfaces.  Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed
        if  the  server's   GatewayPorts   option   is   enabled   (see
        sshd_config(5)).

RequestTTY
        Specifies whether to request a pseudo-tty for the session.  The
        argument  may  be one of: no (never request a TTY), yes (always
        request a TTY when standard input is a TTY), force (always  re‐
        quest  a  TTY) or auto (request a TTY when opening a login ses‐
        sion).  This option mirrors the -t and -T flags for ssh(1).

RequiredRSASize
        Specifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that  ssh(1)  will
        accept.   User authentication keys smaller than this limit will
        be ignored.  Servers that present host keys smaller  than  this
        limit  will cause the connection to be terminated.  The default
        is 1024 bits.  Note that this limit may only be raised from the
        default.

RevokedHostKeys
        Specifies revoked host public keys.  Keys listed in  this  file
        will  be  refused  for  host authentication.  Note that if this
        file does not exist or is not readable, then  host  authentica‐
        tion will be refused for all hosts.  Keys may be specified as a
        text  file,  listing  one public key per line, or as an OpenSSH
        Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by  ssh-keygen(1).   For
        more  information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section
        in ssh-keygen(1).  Arguments to  RevokedHostKeys  may  use  the
        tilde  syntax  to  refer to a user's home directory, the tokens
        described in the “TOKENS” section and environment variables  as
        described in the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

SecurityKeyProvider
        Specifies  a  path  to a library that will be used when loading
        any FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the  default  of
        using the built-in USB HID support.

        If  the  specified  value  begins with a ‘$’ character, then it
        will be treated as an environment variable containing the  path
        to the library.

SendEnv
        Specifies  what  variables  from the local environ(7) should be
        sent to the server.  The server must also support it,  and  the
        server  must  be  configured  to accept these environment vari‐
        ables.  Note that the TERM environment variable is always  sent
        whenever  a  pseudo-terminal  is requested as it is required by
        the protocol.  Refer to AcceptEnv in sshd_config(5) for how  to
        configure  the  server.  Variables are specified by name, which
        may contain wildcard characters.   Multiple  environment  vari‐
        ables  may be separated by whitespace or spread across multiple
        SendEnv directives.

        See “PATTERNS” for more information on patterns.

        It is possible to clear previously set SendEnv  variable  names
        by  prefixing  patterns with -.  The default is not to send any
        environment variables.

ServerAliveCountMax
        Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which  may
        be  sent  without  ssh(1)  receiving any messages back from the
        server.  If this threshold is reached while server  alive  mes‐
        sages are being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, ter‐
        minating  the session.  It is important to note that the use of
        server alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive  (be‐
        low).  The server alive messages are sent through the encrypted
        channel and therefore will not be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive
        option  enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable.  The server alive
        mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on know‐
        ing when a connection has become unresponsive.

        The default value is 3.  If, for  example,  ServerAliveInterval
        (see below) is set to 15 and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the
        default,  if  the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will discon‐
        nect after approximately 45 seconds.

ServerAliveInterval
        Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no  data  has
        been  received  from  the  server,  ssh(1)  will send a message
        through the encrypted channel to request a  response  from  the
        server.   The default is 0, indicating that these messages will
        not be sent to the server, or 300 if the  BatchMode  option  is
        set (Debian-specific).  ProtocolKeepAlives and SetupTimeOut are
        Debian-specific compatibility aliases for this option.

SessionType
        May  be used to either request invocation of a subsystem on the
        remote system, or to prevent the execution of a remote  command
        at  all.   The latter is useful for just forwarding ports.  The
        argument to this keyword must be none (same as the -N  option),
        subsystem  (same as the -s option) or default (shell or command
        execution).

SetEnv  Directly specify one or more environment  variables  and  their
        contents  to be sent to the server.  Similarly to SendEnv, with
        the exception of the TERM variable, the server must be prepared
        to accept the environment variable.

StdinNull
        Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
        stdin).  Either this or the equivalent -n option must  be  used
        when  ssh  is run in the background.  The argument to this key‐
        word must be yes (same as the -n option) or no (the default).

StreamLocalBindMask
        Sets the octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creat‐
        ing a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote port forward‐
        ing.  This option is only used for port forwarding to  a  Unix-
        domain socket file.

        The  default  value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket
        file that is readable and writable only  by  the  owner.   Note
        that  not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-do‐
        main socket files.

StreamLocalBindUnlink
        Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file
        for local or remote port forwarding before creating a new  one.
        If  the socket file already exists and StreamLocalBindUnlink is
        not enabled, ssh will be unable to  forward  the  port  to  the
        Unix-domain  socket  file.   This  option is only used for port
        forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

        The argument must be yes or no (the default).

StrictHostKeyChecking
        If this flag is set to yes, ssh(1) will never automatically add
        host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses  to  con‐
        nect  to hosts whose host key has changed.  This provides maxi‐
        mum protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, though
        it can be annoying when the  /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts  file  is
        poorly  maintained  or  when  connections to new hosts are fre‐
        quently made.  This option forces the user to manually add  all
        new hosts.

        If  this  flag is set to accept-new then ssh will automatically
        add new host keys to the user's known_hosts file, but will  not
        permit  connections  to  hosts with changed host keys.  If this
        flag is set to no or off, ssh will automatically add  new  host
        keys  to  the  user  known hosts files and allow connections to
        hosts with changed hostkeys to proceed,  subject  to  some  re‐
        strictions.  If this flag is set to ask (the default), new host
        keys  will be added to the user known host files only after the
        user has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and ssh
        will refuse to connect to hosts whose  host  key  has  changed.
        The  host keys of known hosts will be verified automatically in
        all cases.

SyslogFacility
        Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from
        ssh(1).  The possible values are: DAEMON, USER,  AUTH,  LOCAL0,
        LOCAL1,  LOCAL2,  LOCAL3,  LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.  The
        default is USER.

TCPKeepAlive
        Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages
        to the other side.  If they are sent, death of  the  connection
        or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  This
        option  only uses TCP keepalives (as opposed to using ssh level
        keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection
        dies.  As such, you probably want the  ServerAliveInterval  op‐
        tion as well.  However, this means that connections will die if
        the  route  is down temporarily, and some people find it annoy‐
        ing.

        The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive  messages),  and  the
        client  will notice if the network goes down or the remote host
        dies.  This is important in scripts, and  many  users  want  it
        too.

        To  disable  TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
        no.    See   also   ServerAliveInterval   for    protocol-level
        keepalives.

Tag     Specify  a  configuration  tag name that may be later used by a
        Match directive to select a block of configuration.

Tunnel  Request tun(4) device forwarding between  the  client  and  the
        server.   The  argument  must be yes, point-to-point (layer 3),
        ethernet (layer 2), or no (the default).   Specifying  yes  re‐
        quests the default tunnel mode, which is point-to-point.

TunnelDevice
        Specifies  the tun(4) devices to open on the client (local_tun)
        and the server (remote_tun).

        The argument must be local_tun[:remote_tun].  The  devices  may
        be specified by numerical ID or the keyword any, which uses the
        next  available tunnel device.  If remote_tun is not specified,
        it defaults to any.  The default is any:any.

UpdateHostKeys
        Specifies whether ssh(1) should accept notifications  of  addi‐
        tional  hostkeys  from the server sent after authentication has
        completed and add them  to  UserKnownHostsFile.   The  argument
        must  be yes, no or ask.  This option allows learning alternate
        hostkeys for a server and supports graceful key rotation by al‐
        lowing a server to send replacement public keys before old ones
        are removed.

        Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key  used  to  au‐
        thenticate  the host was already trusted or explicitly accepted
        by the user, the host was authenticated via  UserKnownHostsFile
        (i.e.  not GlobalKnownHostsFile) and the host was authenticated
        using a plain key and not a certificate.

        UpdateHostKeys is enabled by default if the user has not  over‐
        ridden  the  default UserKnownHostsFile setting and has not en‐
        abled VerifyHostKeyDNS, otherwise UpdateHostKeys will be set to
        no.

        If UpdateHostKeys is set to ask, then the user is asked to con‐
        firm the modifications to the known_hosts  file.   Confirmation
        is currently incompatible with ControlPersist, and will be dis‐
        abled if it is enabled.

        Presently,  only  sshd(8)  from OpenSSH 6.8 and greater support
        the "hostkeys@openssh.com" protocol extension  used  to  inform
        the client of all the server's hostkeys.

User    Specifies  the  user  to  log in as.  This can be useful when a
        different user name is used on different machines.  This  saves
        the  trouble of having to remember to give the user name on the
        command line.

UserKnownHostsFile
        Specifies one or more files to use for the user host key  data‐
        base, separated by whitespace.  Each filename may use tilde no‐
        tation  to  refer  to the user's home directory, the tokens de‐
        scribed in the “TOKENS” section and  environment  variables  as
        described  in  the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.  A value of
        none causes ssh(1) to  ignore  any  user-specific  known  hosts
        files.  The default is ~/.ssh/known_hosts, ~/.ssh/known_hosts2.

VerifyHostKeyDNS
        Specifies  whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP
        resource records.  If this option is set  to  yes,  the  client
        will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint from
        DNS.   Insecure  fingerprints will be handled as if this option
        was set to ask.  If this option is set to ask,  information  on
        fingerprint  match  will  be displayed, but the user will still
        need   to   confirm   new   host   keys   according   to    the
        StrictHostKeyChecking option.  The default is no.

        See also “VERIFYING HOST KEYS” in ssh(1).

VisualHostKey
        If  this flag is set to yes, an ASCII art representation of the
        remote host key fingerprint is printed in addition to the  fin‐
        gerprint  string  at  login and for unknown host keys.  If this
        flag is set to no (the default),  no  fingerprint  strings  are
        printed  at  login  and  only  the  fingerprint  string will be
        printed for unknown host keys.

XAuthLocation
        Specifies the full pathname of the xauth(1) program.   The  de‐
        fault is /usr/bin/xauth.
```



### Patterns {#patterns}

```
A  pattern  consists  of zero or more non-whitespace characters, ‘*’ (a
wildcard that matches zero or more characters), or ‘?’ (a wildcard that
matches exactly one character).  For example, to specify a set of  dec‐
larations  for  any  host in the ".co.uk" set of domains, the following
pattern could be used:

      Host *.co.uk

The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.[0-9]  net‐
work range:

      Host 192.168.0.?

A  pattern-list is a comma-separated list of patterns.  Patterns within
pattern-lists may be negated by preceding them with an exclamation mark
(‘!’).  For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere within  an
organization except from the "dialup" pool, the following entry (in au‐
thorized_keys) could be used:

      from="!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com"

Note  that  a negated match will never produce a positive result by it‐
self.  For example, attempting to match "host3" against  the  following
pattern-list will fail:

      from="!host1,!host2"

The  solution  here  is  to  include  a term that will yield a positive
match, such as a wildcard:

      from="!host1,!host2,*"
```



### Tokens {#tokens}

```
Arguments to some keywords can make use of tokens, which  are  expanded
at runtime:

      %%    A literal ‘%’.
      %C    Hash of %l%h%p%r%j.
      %d    Local user's home directory.
      %f    The fingerprint of the server's host key.
      %H    The  known_hosts hostname or address that is being searched
            for.
      %h    The remote hostname.
      %I    A string describing the reason for a KnownHostsCommand exe‐
            cution: either ADDRESS when looking up a  host  by  address
            (only when CheckHostIP is enabled), HOSTNAME when searching
            by hostname, or ORDER when preparing the host key algorithm
            preference list to use for the destination host.
      %i    The local user ID.
      %j    The  contents  of the ProxyJump option, or the empty string
            if this option is unset.
      %K    The base64 encoded host key.
      %k    The host key alias if specified, otherwise the original re‐
            mote hostname given on the command line.
      %L    The local hostname.
      %l    The local hostname, including the domain name.
      %n    The original remote hostname, as given on the command line.
      %p    The remote port.
      %r    The remote username.
      %T    The local tun(4) or tap(4) network  interface  assigned  if
            tunnel forwarding was requested, or "NONE" otherwise.
      %t    The type of the server host key, e.g.  ssh-ed25519.
      %u    The local username.

CertificateFile,      ControlPath,     IdentityAgent,     IdentityFile,
KnownHostsCommand,    LocalForward,    Match    exec,    RemoteCommand,
RemoteForward,  RevokedHostKeys,  and UserKnownHostsFile accept the to‐
kens %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %j, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u.

KnownHostsCommand additionally accepts the tokens %f, %H,  %I,  %K  and
%t.

Hostname accepts the tokens %% and %h.

LocalCommand accepts all tokens.

ProxyCommand and ProxyJump accept the tokens %%, %h, %n, %p, and %r.

Note that some of these directives build commands for execution via the
shell.   Because ssh(1) performs no filtering or escaping of characters
that have special meaning in shell commands (e.g. quotes),  it  is  the
user's  responsibility to ensure that the arguments passed to ssh(1) do
not contain such characters and that tokens  are  appropriately  quoted
when used.
```



### Environment Variables {#environment-variables}

```
Arguments  to some keywords can be expanded at runtime from environment
variables  on  the  client  by  enclosing  them  in  ${},  for  example
${HOME}/.ssh  would refer to the user's .ssh directory.  If a specified
environment variable does not exist then an error will be returned  and
the setting for that keyword will be ignored.

The keywords CertificateFile, ControlPath, IdentityAgent, IdentityFile,
KnownHostsCommand,  and  UserKnownHostsFile  support  environment vari‐
ables.  The keywords LocalForward and RemoteForward support environment
variables only for Unix domain socket paths.
```



### Files {#files}

```
~/.ssh/config
        This is the per-user configuration file.  The  format  of  this
        file  is described above.  This file is used by the SSH client.
        Because of the potential for abuse, this file must have  strict
        permissions:  read/write for the user, and not writable by oth‐
        ers.  It may be group-writable provided that the group in ques‐
        tion contains only the user.

/etc/ssh/ssh_config
        Systemwide configuration file.  This file provides defaults for
        those values that are not specified in the user's configuration
        file, and for those users who do not have a configuration file.
        This file must be world-readable.
```
