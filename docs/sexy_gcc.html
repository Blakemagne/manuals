</code></pre><h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2><p>` gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard]     [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]     [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic]     [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]     [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro]     [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...]     [-o outfile] [@file] infile...</p><p>Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.  g++ accepts mostly the same options as gcc. `</p><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>` When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.</p><p>Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.  Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.</p><p>Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use that option with all supported languages.</p><p>The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called gcc, or machine-gcc when cross-compiling, or machine-gcc-version to run a specific version of GCC.  When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as g++ instead.</p><p>The gcc program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options may not be grouped: -dv is very different from -d -v.</p><p>You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify -L more than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also, the placement of the -l option is significant.</p><p>Many options have long names starting with -f or with -W---for example, -fmove-loop-invariants, -Wformat and so on.  Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo is -fno-foo.  This manual documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.</p><p>Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either by a space or by the equals sign (=) from the option name.  Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or a string.  Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must begin with the 0x prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a size threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes such as "kB" and "KiB" for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively, "MB" and "MiB" for megabyte and mebibyte, "GB" and "GiB" for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such arguments are designated by byte-size in the following text.  Refer to the NIST, IEC, and other relevant national and international standards for the full listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size prefixes. `</p><h2 id="options">Options</h2><p>Option Summary ` Here is a summary of all the options, grouped by type.

Options -save-temps=cwd and -save-temps=obj override this default, just like an            explicit -dumpdir option.  In case multiple such options are given, the last one prevails:</p><p>gcc -dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c -save-temps=obj ...</p><p>outputs foo.o, with auxiliary outputs named foo.* because -save-temps=* overrides the dumppfx given by the earlier  -dumpdir  option.   It  does  not  matter  that  =obj  is  the  default  for            <b>`-save-temps`</b>, nor that the output directory is implicitly the current directory.  Dump outputs are named foo.c.*.</p><p>` When  compiling  from  multiple input files, if -dumpbase is specified, dumpbase, minus a auxdropsuf suffix, and a dash are appended to (or override, if containing any directory components) an explicit or defaulted dumppfx, so that each of the multiple compilations gets differently-named aux and dump outputs.</p><p>gcc foo.c bar.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main ...</p><p>outputs  auxiliary  dumps  to  dir/pfx-main-foo.*  and  dir/pfx-main-bar.*,  appending  dumpbase-  to  dumppfx.   Dump  outputs  retain  the  input  file  suffix:   dir/pfx-main-foo.c.*    and dir/pfx-main-bar.c.*, respectively.  Contrast with the single-input compilation:</p><p>gcc foo.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main ...</p><p>that, applying -dumpbase to a single source, does not compute and append a separate dumpbase per input file.  Its auxiliary and dump outputs go in dir/pfx-main.*.</p><p>When  compiling  and  then  linking  from multiple input files, a defaulted or explicitly specified dumppfx also undergoes the dumpbase- transformation above (e.g. the compilation of foo.c and bar.c above, but without -c).  If neither -dumpdir nor -dumpbase are given, the linker output base name, minus auxdropsuf, if specified, or the executable suffix  otherwise,  plus  a  dash  is appended to the default dumppfx instead.  Note, however, that unlike earlier cases of linking:</p><p>gcc foo.c bar.c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -o main ...</p><p>does  not  append the output name main to dumppfx, because -dumpdir is explicitly specified.  The goal is that the explicitly-specified dumppfx may contain the specified output name as part of the prefix, if desired; only an explicitly-specified -dumpbase would be combined with it, in order to avoid simply discarding a meaningful option.</p><p>When compiling and then linking from a single input file, the linker output base name will only be appended to the default dumppfx as above if it does not share the base name with  the  single input file name.  This has been covered in single-input linking cases above, but not with an explicit -dumpdir that inhibits the combination, even if overridden by -save-temps=*:</p><p>gcc foo.c -dumpdir alt/pfx- -o dir/main.exe -save-temps=cwd ...</p><p>Auxiliary outputs are named foo.*, and dump outputs foo.c.*, in the current working directory as ultimately requested by -save-temps=cwd.</p><p>Summing  it  all  up  for  an  intuitive  though slightly imprecise data flow: the primary output name is broken into a directory part and a basename part; dumppfx is set to the former, unless overridden by -dumpdir or -save-temps=*, and dumpbase is set to the latter, unless overriden by -dumpbase.  If there are multiple inputs or linking, this dumpbase may be combined with  dumppfx and  taken  from  each  input  file.   Auxiliary output names for each input are formed by combining dumppfx, dumpbase minus suffix, and the auxiliary output suffix; dump output names are only different in that the suffix from dumpbase is retained.</p><p>When it comes to auxiliary and dump outputs created during LTO recompilation, a combination of dumppfx and dumpbase, as given or as derived from the linker output name  but  not  from  inputs, even  in  cases  in  which  this  combination would not otherwise be used as such, is passed down with a trailing period replacing the compiler-added dash, if any, as a -dumpdir option to lto- wrapper; being involved in linking, this program does not normally get any -dumpbase and -dumpbase-ext, and it ignores them.</p><p>When running sub-compilers, lto-wrapper appends LTO stage names to the received dumppfx, ensures it contains a directory component so that  it  overrides  any  -dumpdir,  and  passes  that  as -dumpbase to sub-compilers. `</p><p><b>`-v  Print`</b>  (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages of compilation.

The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on            those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition, when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may  use  information            about  that  function  to  warn  about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function.

Specifying this option disables that optimization,  and            forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++ to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.</p><p>In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this option still affects trivial member functions.</p><p><b>`-fno-enforce-eh-specs`</b>            Don't  generate code to check for violation of exception specifications at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code size in production builds, much            like defining "NDEBUG".  This does not give user code permission to throw exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler still optimizes based on the specifications,  so            throwing an unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.</p><p><b>`-fextern-tls-init`</b>        <b>`-fno-extern-tls-init`</b>            The  C++11 and OpenMP standards allow "thread_local" and "threadprivate" variables to have dynamic (runtime) initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes through a wrapper            function that performs any necessary initialization.  When the use and definition of the variable are in the same translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the use is  in            a  different  translation  unit there is significant overhead even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a            non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses  in            another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the -fno-extern-tls-init option.</p><p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is -fextern-tls-init.

Since these functions are rarely interesting to debug, this flag is enabled by default unless -fno-inline is active.</p><p><b>`-fno-gnu-keywords`</b>            Do  not recognize "typeof" as a keyword, so that code can use this word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword "__typeof__" instead.

If  the            function has local variables of types with non-trivial destructors, the exception specification actually makes the function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be optimized            away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of a function with such an exception specification results in a call to "terminate" rather than "unexpected".</p><p><b>`-fno-operator-names`</b>            Do not treat the operator name keywords "and", "bitand", "bitor", "compl", "not", "or" and "xor" as synonyms as keywords.</p><p><b>`-fno-optional-diags`</b>            Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for a name having multiple meanings within a class.</p><p><b>`-fpermissive`</b>            Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to warnings.  Thus, using -fpermissive allows some nonconforming code to compile.</p><p><b>`-fno-pretty-templates`</b>            When  an  error  message  refers  to  a specialization of a function template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or            typenames in the signature (e.g. "void f(T) [with T = int]" rather than "void f(int)") so that it's clear which template is involved.  When an error message refers to  a  specialization  of  a            class  template,  the  compiler  omits  any template arguments that match the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these behaviors make it harder to understand the error            message rather than easier, you can use -fno-pretty-templates to disable them.</p><p><b>`-fno-rtti`</b>            Disable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features ("dynamic_cast" and "typeid").  If you don't use those parts            of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as needed. The "dynamic_cast" operator can  still  be            used for casts that do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to "void *" or to unambiguous base classes.</p><p>Mixing  code  compiled  with  -frtti  with  that  compiled with -fno-rtti may not work.  For example, programs may fail to link if a class compiled with -fno-rtti is used as a base for a class            compiled with -frtti.</p><p><b>`-fsized-deallocation`</b>            Enable the built-in global declarations</p><p>void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;                    void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;</p><p>as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under            <b>`-std`</b>=c++14 and above.  The flag -Wsized-deallocation warns about places that might want to add a definition.</p><p><b>`-fstrict-enums`</b>            Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as defined in the C++ standard; basically,  a  value  that            can be represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to            the enumerated type.</p><p><b>`-fstrong-eval-order`</b>            Evaluate  member  access,  array  subscripting,  and  shift  expressions  in left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment in right-to-left order, as adopted for C++17.  Enabled by default with            <b>`-std`</b>=c++17.  -fstrong-eval-order=some enables just the ordering of member access and shift expressions, and is the default without -std=c++17.</p><p><b>`-ftemplate-backtrace-limit`</b>=n            Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single warning or error to n.  The default value is 10.</p><p><b>`-ftemplate-depth`</b>=n            Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to n.  A limit on the template instantiation depth is  needed  to  detect  endless  recursions  during  template  class  instantiation.            ANSI/ISO  C++  conforming  programs  must  not  rely on a maximum depth greater than 17 (changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler can run out of stack space before            hitting 1024 in some situations.</p><p><b>`-fno-threadsafe-statics`</b>            Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this option to reduce code  size  slightly  in  code  that            doesn't need to be thread-safe.</p><p><b>`-fuse-cxa-atexit`</b>            Register  destructors  for  objects  with  static  storage  duration  with the "__cxa_atexit" function rather than the "atexit" function.  This option is required for fully standards-compliant            handling of static destructors, but only works if your C library supports "__cxa_atexit".</p><p><b>`-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr`</b>            Don't use the "__cxa_get_exception_ptr" runtime routine.  This causes "std::uncaught_exception" to be incorrect, but is necessary if the runtime routine is not available.</p><p><b>`-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`</b>            This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions are taken in different shared objects.</p><p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with "__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))" so that they do not appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a            PLT indirection when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the dynamic export table when the            library makes heavy use of templates.</p><p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables local to the function or cause the compiler  to  deduce            that the function is defined in only one shared object.</p><p>You  may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to compare pointers to a particular inline method, you            might mark it as having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit visibility has no effect.</p><p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.</p><p><b>`-fvisibility-ms-compat`</b>            This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++ linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.</p><p>The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:</p><ol><li> It sets the default visibility to "hidden", like -fvisibility=hidden.</li></ol><p>2.  Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.</p><p>3.  The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit visibility specifications that are defined in more than one shared object:  those  declarations  are  permitted  if  they  are                permitted when this option is not used.</p><p>In  new  code it is better to use -fvisibility=hidden and export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.  Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,            on the Visual Studio behavior.</p><p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared objects are different, so changing one does not  change            the other; and that pointers to function members defined in different shared objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a violation of the ODR to define types with the same            name differently.</p><p><b>`-fno-weak`</b>            Do  not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.  By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This option exists only for testing, and should not be used by            end-users; it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may be removed in a future release of G++.</p><p><b>`-fext-numeric-literals`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Accept imaginary, fixed-point, or machine-defined literal number suffixes as GNU extensions.

This usage was deprecated in C++20 and is going to be removed in C++23.  However, a comma expression wrapped in  "(  )"            is not deprecated.  Example:</p><p>void f(int *a, int b, int c) {                        a[b,c];     // deprecated in C++20, invalid in C++23                        a[(b,c)];   // OK                    }</p><p>In  C++23  it  is valid to have comma separated expressions in a subscript when an overloaded subscript operator is found and supports the right number and types of arguments.  G++ will accept            the formerly valid syntax for code that is not valid in C++23 but used to be valid but deprecated in C++20 with a pedantic warning that can be disabled with -Wno-comma-subscript.</p><p>Enabled by default with -std=c++20 unless -Wno-deprecated, and with -std=c++23 regardless of -Wno-deprecated.</p><p><b>`-Wctad-maybe-unsupported`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when performing class template argument deduction (CTAD) on a type with no explicitly written deduction guides.  This warning will point out cases where CTAD succeeded  only  because  the            compiler  synthesized  the implicit deduction guides, which might not be what the programmer intended.  Certain style guides allow CTAD only on types that specifically "opt-in"; i.e., on types            that are designed to support CTAD.  This warning can be suppressed with the following pattern:</p><p>struct allow_ctad_t; // any name works                    template <typename T> struct S {                      S(T) { }                    };                    // Guide with incomplete parameter type will never be considered.

Also warn if  there  are            no non-private methods, and there's at least one private member function that isn't a constructor or destructor.</p><p><b>`-Wdangling-reference`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when a reference is bound to a temporary whose lifetime has ended.  For example:</p><p>int n = 1;                    const int& r = std::max(n - 1, n + 1); // r is dangling</p><p>In the example above, two temporaries are created, one for each argument, and a reference to one of the temporaries is returned.  However, both temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full            expression, so the reference "r" is dangling.  This warning also detects dangling references in member initializer lists:</p><p>const int& f(const int& i) { return i; }                    struct S {                      const int &r; // r is dangling                      S() : r(f(10)) { }                    };</p><p>Member functions are checked as well, but only their object argument:</p><p>struct S {                       const S& self () { return *this; }                    };                    const S& s = S().self(); // s is dangling</p><p>Certain  functions  are  safe  in  this  respect,  for example "std::use_facet": they take and return a reference, but they don't return one of its arguments, which can fool the warning.

It is unsafe to delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a            base class if the base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wdeprecated-copy`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn that the implicit declaration of a copy constructor or copy assignment operator is deprecated if the class has a user-provided copy constructor or copy assignment operator, in  C++11  and            up.

This            conversion was deprecated in C++20.  For example:</p><p>enum E1 { e };                    enum E2 { f };                    int k = f - e;</p><p><b>`-Wdeprecated-enum-enum-conversion is`</b> enabled by default with -std=c++20.

This  conversion            was deprecated in C++20.  For example:</p><p>enum E1 { e };                    enum E2 { f };                    bool b = e <= 3.7;</p><p><b>`-Wdeprecated-enum-float-conversion is`</b> enabled by default with -std=c++20.

Since the underlying array for an "initializer_list" is handled like a normal C++ temporary            object, it is easy to inadvertently keep a pointer to the array past the end of the array's lifetime.  For example:</p><p>*   If a function returns a temporary "initializer_list", or a local "initializer_list" variable, the array's lifetime ends at the end of the return statement, so  the  value  returned  has  a                dangling pointer.</p><p>*   If a new-expression creates an "initializer_list", the array only lives until the end of the enclosing full-expression, so the "initializer_list" in the heap has a dangling pointer.</p><p>*   When  an  "initializer_list"  variable  is assigned from a brace-enclosed initializer list, the temporary array created for the right side of the assignment only lives until the end of the                full-expression, so at the next statement the "initializer_list" variable has a dangling pointer.</p><p>// li's initial underlying array lives as long as li                        std::initializer_list<int> li = { 1,2,3 };                        // assignment changes li to point to a temporary array                        li = { 4, 5 };                        // now the temporary is gone and li has a dangling pointer                        int i = li.begin()[0] // undefined behavior</p><p>*   When a list constructor stores the "begin" pointer from the "initializer_list" argument, this doesn't extend the lifetime of the array, so  if  a  class  variable  is  constructed  from  a                temporary "initializer_list", the pointer is left dangling by the end of the variable declaration statement.</p><p><b>`-Winvalid-constexpr`</b>            Warn  when a function never produces a constant expression.  In C++20 and earlier, for every "constexpr" function and function template, there must be at least one set of function arguments in            at least one instantiation such that an invocation of the function or constructor could be an evaluated subexpression of a core constant expression.  C++23 removed this  restriction,  so  it's            possible to have a function or a function template marked "constexpr" for which no invocation satisfies the requirements of a core constant expression.</p><p>This warning is enabled as a pedantic warning by default in C++20 and earlier.  In C++23, -Winvalid-constexpr can be turned on, in which case it will be an ordinary warning.  For example:</p><p>void f (int& i);                    constexpr void                    g (int& i)                    {                      // Warns by default in C++20, in C++23 only with -Winvalid-constexpr.                      f(i);                    }</p><p><b>`-Winvalid-imported-macros`</b>            Verify  all imported macro definitions are valid at the end of compilation.  This is not enabled by default, as it requires additional processing to determine.  It may be useful when preparing            sets of header-units to ensure consistent macros.</p><p><b>`-Wno-literal-suffix`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Do not warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does not begin  with  an  underscore.   As  a  conforming  extension,  GCC  treats  such  suffixes  as  separate            preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from "<inttypes.h>".  For example:</p><p>#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS                    #include <inttypes.h>                    #include <stdio.h></p><p>int main() {                      int64_t i64 = 123;                      printf("My int64: %" PRId64"\n", i64);                    }</p><p>In this case, "PRId64" is treated as a separate preprocessing token.</p><p>This  option  also  controls  warnings  when a user-defined literal operator is declared with a literal suffix identifier that doesn't begin with an underscore. Literal suffix identifiers that            don't begin with an underscore are reserved for future standardization.</p><p>These warnings are enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wno-narrowing`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            For C++11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are diagnosed by default, as required by the standard.  A narrowing  conversion  from  a  constant  produces  an  error,  and  a  narrowing            conversion  from  a  non-constant  produces  a warning, but -Wno-narrowing suppresses the diagnostic.  Note that this does not affect the meaning of well-formed code; narrowing conversions are            still considered ill-formed in SFINAE contexts.</p><p>With -Wnarrowing in C++98, warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs within { }, e.g.</p><p>int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int</p><p>This flag is included in -Wall and -Wc++11-compat.</p><p><b>`-Wnoexcept`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception specification (i.e. throw() or "noexcept") but is  known  by  the            compiler to never throw an exception.</p><p><b>`-Wnoexcept-type`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn if the C++17 feature making "noexcept" part of a function type changes the mangled name of a symbol relative to C++14.  Enabled by -Wabi and -Wc++17-compat.</p><p>As an example:</p><p>template <class T> void f(T t) { t(); };                    void g() noexcept;                    void h() { f(g); }</p><p>In C++14, "f" calls "f<void(*)()>", but in C++17 it calls "f<void(*)()noexcept>".</p><p><b>`-Wclass-memaccess`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function such as "memset" or "memcpy" is an object of class type, and when writing into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or            deleted  constructor  or  copy  assignment,  violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt virtual table pointers.  Modifying the representation of such objects may violate invariants            maintained by member functions of the class.  For example, the call to "memset" below is undefined because it modifies a non-trivial class object and is, therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to            either initialize or clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the appropriate constructor or assignment operator, if one is available.</p><p>std::string str = "abc";                    memset (&str, 0, sizeof str);</p><p>The -Wclass-memaccess option is enabled by -Wall.  Explicitly casting the pointer to the class object to "void *" or to a type that can be safely accessed by the raw memory function suppresses            the warning.</p><p><b>`-Wnon-virtual-dtor`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which case  it  is  possible  but  unsafe  to  delete  an            instance of a derived class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This warning is automatically enabled if -Weffc++ is specified.  The -Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor option (enabled            by -Wall) should be preferred because it warns about the unsafe cases without false positives.</p><p><b>`-Wregister`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn  on  uses of the "register" storage class specifier, except when it is part of the GNU Explicit Register Variables extension.  The use of the "register" keyword as storage class specifier            has been deprecated in C++11 and removed in C++17.  Enabled by default with -std=c++17.</p><p><b>`-Wreorder`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:</p><p>struct A {                      int i;                      int j;                      A(): j (0), i (1) { }                    };</p><p>The compiler rearranges the member initializers for "i" and "j" to match the declaration order of the members, emitting a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wno-pessimizing-move`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            This warning warns when a call to "std::move" prevents copy elision.  A typical scenario when copy elision can occur is when returning in  a  function  with  a  class  return  type,  when  the            expression being returned is the name of a non-volatile automatic object, and is not a function parameter, and has the same type as the function return type.</p><p>struct T {                    ...                    };                    T fn()                    {                      T t;                      ...                      return std::move (t);                    }</p><p>But in this example, the "std::move" call prevents copy elision.</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wno-redundant-move`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            This  warning  warns  about  redundant  calls  to "std::move"; that is, when a move operation would have been performed even without the "std::move" call.  This happens because the compiler is            forced to treat the object as if it were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local variable, where copy elision isn't applicable.  Consider:</p><p>struct T {                    ...                    };                    T fn(T t)                    {                      ...                      return std::move (t);                    }</p><p>Here, the "std::move" call is redundant.  Because G++ implements Core Issue 1579, another example is:</p><p>struct T { // convertible to U                    ...                    };                    struct U {                    ...                    };                    U fn()                    {                      T t;                      ...                      return std::move (t);                    }</p><p>In this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the type of the expression being returned and the function return type differ, yet G++ treats the return value as if it  were  designated            by an rvalue.</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wextra.</p><p><b>`-Wrange-loop-construct`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            This warning warns when a C++ range-based for-loop is creating an unnecessary copy.  This can happen when the range declaration is not a reference, but probably should be.  For example:</p><p>struct S { char arr[128]; };                    void fn () {                      S arr[5];                      for (const auto x : arr) { ... }                    }</p><p>It does not warn when the type being copied is a trivially-copyable type whose size is less than 64 bytes.</p><p>This warning also warns when a loop variable in a range-based for-loop is initialized with a value of a different type resulting in a copy.  For example:</p><p>void fn() {                      int arr[10];                      for (const double &x : arr) { ... }                    }</p><p>In the example above, in every iteration of the loop a temporary value of type "double" is created and destroyed, to which the reference "const double &" is bound.</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wredundant-tags`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn about redundant class-key and enum-key in references to class types and enumerated types in contexts where the key can be eliminated without causing an ambiguity.  For example:</p><p>struct foo;                    struct foo *p;   // warn that keyword struct can be eliminated</p><p>On the other hand, in this example there is no warning:</p><p>struct foo;                    void foo ();   // "hides" struct foo                    void bar (struct foo&);  // no warning, keyword struct is necessary</p><p><b>`-Wno-subobject-linkage`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Do  not  warn  if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous namespace or depends on a type with no linkage.  If a type A depends on a type B with no or internal linkage,            defining it in multiple translation units would be an ODR violation because the meaning of B is different in each translation unit.  If A only appears in a single translation  unit,  the  best            way  to  silence  the  warning is to give it internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well.  The compiler doesn't give this warning for types defined in the main .C file, as            those are unlikely to have multiple definitions.  -Wsubobject-linkage is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Weffc`</b>++ (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers' Effective C++ series of books:</p><p>*   Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes with dynamically-allocated memory.</p><p>*   Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.</p><p>*   Have "operator=" return a reference to *this.</p><p>*   Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.</p><p>*   Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operators.</p><p>*   Never overload "&&", "||", or ",".</p><p>This option also enables -Wnon-virtual-dtor, which is also one of the effective C++ recommendations.

When compiling only with GCC this is a valid sentinel, as "NULL" is defined to "__null".  Although it is a null pointer constant rather            than a null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is not portable across different compilers.</p><p><b>`-Wno-non-template-friend`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Disable warnings when non-template friend functions are declared within a template.  In very old versions of GCC that predate implementation of the ISO standard, declarations  such  as  friend            int  foo(int),  where  the  name  of  the  friend is an unqualified-id, could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a template function; the warning exists to diagnose compatibility            problems, and is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wold-style-cast`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within a C++ program.

Level 1 is included in -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wno-pmf-conversions`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function to a plain pointer.</p><p><b>`-Wsign-promo`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn  when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to            preserve unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.</p><p><b>`-Wtemplates`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.  Some coding rules disallow templates, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,            such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.

This  includes  invocations  of  C++  "operator            delete"  with  pointers  returned from either mismatched forms of "operator new", or from other functions that allocate objects for which the "operator delete" isn't a suitable deallocator, as            well as calls to other deallocation functions with pointers returned from "operator new" for which the deallocation function isn't suitable.</p><p>For example, the "delete" expression in the function below is diagnosed because it doesn't match the array form of the "new" expression the pointer argument was returned from.  Similarly,  the            call to "free" is also diagnosed.</p><p>void f ()                    {                      int *a = new int[n];                      delete a;   // warning: mismatch in array forms of expressions</p><p>char *p = new char[n];                      free (p);   // warning: mismatch between new and free                    }</p><p>The related option -Wmismatched-dealloc diagnoses mismatches involving allocation and deallocation functions other than "operator new" and "operator delete".</p><p><b>`-Wmismatched-new-delete is`</b> included in -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wmismatched-tags`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn for declarations of structs, classes, and class templates and their specializations with a class-key that does not match either the definition or the first declaration if no definition is            provided.</p><p>For  example, the declaration of "struct Object" in the argument list of "draw" triggers the warning.  To avoid it, either remove the redundant class-key "struct" or replace it with "class" to            match its definition.</p><p>class Object {                    public:                      virtual ~Object () = 0;                    };                    void draw (struct Object*);</p><p>It is not wrong to declare a class with the class-key "struct" as the example above shows.  The -Wmismatched-tags option is intended to help achieve a consistent style of  class  declarations.            In  code  that  is  intended  to be portable to Windows-based compilers the warning helps prevent unresolved references due to the difference in the mangling of symbols declared with different            class-keys.  The option can be used either on its own or in conjunction with -Wredundant-tags.</p><p><b>`-Wmultiple-inheritance`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base classes.  Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive  inside  a            system header file, such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may also define classes that indirectly use multiple inheritance.</p><p><b>`-Wvirtual-inheritance`</b>            Warn  when  a  class is defined with a virtual direct base class.  Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a            system header file, such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may also define classes that indirectly use virtual inheritance.</p><p><b>`-Wno-virtual-move-assign`</b>            Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because if the virtual base is reachable along more than one  path,            it  is  moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid moving from a moved-from object, this warning can            be disabled.</p><p><b>`-Wnamespaces`</b>            Warn when a namespace definition is opened.  Some coding rules disallow namespaces, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the            STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may also use using directives and qualified names.</p><p><b>`-Wno-terminate`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Disable the warning about a throw-expression that will immediately result in a call to "terminate".</p><p><b>`-Wno-vexing-parse`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn about the most vexing parse syntactic ambiguity.  This warns about the cases when a declaration looks like a variable definition, but the C++ language requires it to be interpreted  as  a            function declaration.  For instance:</p><p>void f(double a) {                      int i();        // extern int i (void);                      int n(int(a));  // extern int n (int);                    }</p><p>Another example:</p><p>struct S { S(int); };                    void f(double a) {                      S x(int(a));   // extern struct S x (int);                      S y(int());    // extern struct S y (int (*) (void));                      S z();         // extern struct S z (void);                    }</p><p>The warning will suggest options how to deal with such an ambiguity; e.g., it can suggest removing the parentheses or using braces instead.</p><p>This warning is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wno-class-conversion`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Do not warn when a conversion function converts an object to the same type, to a base class of that type, or to void; such a conversion function will never be called.</p><p><b>`-Wvolatile`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            Warn  about  deprecated  uses  of  the  "volatile" qualifier.  This includes postfix and prefix "++" and "--" expressions of "volatile"-qualified types, using simple assignments where the left            operand is a "volatile"-qualified non-class type for their value, compound assignments where the left operand is a "volatile"-qualified non-class  type,  "volatile"-qualified  function  return            type, "volatile"-qualified parameter type, and structured bindings of a "volatile"-qualified type.

This            allows  GCC  to  more aggressively devirtualize the polymorphic calls. This warning is more effective with link-time optimization, where the information about the class hierarchy graph is more            complete.</p><p><b>`-Wsuggest-final-methods`</b>            Warn about virtual methods where code quality would be improved if the method were declared with the C++11 "final" specifier, or, if possible, its type were declared in an anonymous  namespace            or  with  the "final" specifier.

As at level 2, uses in equality (or                inequality) expressions are not diagnosed.  For example, the second call to "free" in the following function is diagnosed at this level:</p><p>struct A { int refcount; void *data; };</p><p>void release (struct A *p)                        {                          int refcount = --p->refcount;                          free (p);                          if (refcount == 0)                            free (p->data);   // warning: p may be used after free                        }</p><p><b>`-Wuse-after-free`</b>=3                At level 3, the warning also diagnoses uses of indeterminate pointers in equality expressions.  All uses of indeterminate pointers are undefined but equality tests sometimes  appear  after                calls  to  "realloc"  as  an  attempt  to  determine  whether  the call resulted in relocating the object to a different address.  They are diagnosed at a separate level to aid legacy code                gradually transition to safe alternatives.  For example, the equality test in the function below is diagnosed at this level:</p><p>void adjust_pointers (int**, int);</p><p>void grow (int <b>p, int n)                        {                          int </b>q = (int<b>)realloc (p, n *= 2);                          if (q == p)                            return;                          adjust_pointers ((int</b>)q, n);                        }</p><p>To avoid the warning at this level, store offsets into allocated memory instead of pointers.

This  option  is  only  available  with the NeXT runtime; the GNU runtime has a different garbage collection            implementation that does not require special compiler flags.</p><p><b>`-fobjc-nilcheck`</b>            For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a nil receiver in method invocations before  doing  the  actual  method  call.   This  is  the  default  and  can  be  disabled  using            <b>`-fno-objc-nilcheck`</b>.  Class methods and super calls are never checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.  Currently this flag does nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older <code> version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is used. </code></p><p><b>`-fobjc-std`</b>=objc1            Conform  to  the  language  syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only affects the Objective-C additions to the C/C++ language; it does not affect conformance to            C/C++ standards, which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect option flags.  When this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler, any Objective-C syntax  that  is  not            recognized by GCC 4.0 is rejected.  This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can be compiled with older versions of GCC.</p><p><b>`-freplace-objc-classes`</b>            Emit a special marker instructing <a href="./ld.html">ld(1)</a> not to statically link in the resulting object file, and allow <a href="./dyld.html">dyld(1)</a> to load it in at run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-            Continue  debugging  mode,  where  the  object  file  in question may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need to restart the program itself.            Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.</p><p><b>`-fzero-link`</b>            When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls to objc_getClass("...") (when the name of the class is known at compile time) with static class references that  get            initialized  at  load  time,  which  improves run-time performance.  Specifying the -fzero-link flag suppresses this behavior and causes calls to objc_getClass("...")  to be retained.  This is            useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows for individual class implementations to be  modified  during  program  execution.   The  GNU  runtime  currently  always  retains  calls  to            objc_get_class("...")  regardless of command-line options.</p><p><b>`-fno-local-ivars`</b>            By  default  instance  variables  in  Objective-C  can be accessed as if they were local variables from within the methods of the class they're declared in.  This can lead to shadowing between            instance variables and other variables declared either locally inside a class method or globally with the same name.  Specifying the -fno-local-ivars flag disables this behavior thus  avoiding            variable shadowing issues.</p><p><b>`-fivar-visibility`</b>=[public|protected|private|package]            Set  the  default  instance  variable  visibility  to  the  specified  option  so  that instance variables declared outside the scope of any access modifier directives default to the specified            visibility.</p><p><b>`-gen-decls`</b>            Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a file named sourcename.decl.</p><p><b>`-Wassign-intercept`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the garbage collector.</p><p><b>`-Wno-property-assign-default`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Do not warn if a property for an Objective-C object has no assign semantics specified.</p><p><b>`-Wno-protocol`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The default behavior is to issue a warning for every            method not explicitly implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited from the superclass.  If you  use  the  -Wno-protocol  option,  then  methods  inherited  from  the            superclass are considered to be implemented, and no warning is issued for them.</p><p><b>`-Wobjc-root-class`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Warn  if  a  class  interface  lacks  a superclass. Most classes will inherit from "NSObject" (or "Object") for example.  When declaring classes intended to be root classes, the warning can be            suppressed by marking their interfaces with "__attribute__((objc_root_class))".</p><p><b>`-Wselector`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally,            a check is performed for each selector appearing in a @selector(...)  expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found during compilation.  Because these checks scan the            method table only at the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error  is  found  during  compilation,  or            because the -fsyntax-only option is being used.</p><p><b>`-Wstrict-selector-match`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type "id" or "Class".            When this flag is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size and alignment.</p><p><b>`-Wundeclared-selector`</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Warn  if  a @selector(...) expression referring to an undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no method with that name has been declared before the @selector(...)            expression, either explicitly in an @interface or @protocol declaration, or implicitly in an @implementation section.  This option always performs  its  checks  as  soon  as  a  @selector(...)            expression  is  found,  while -Wselector only performs its checks in the final stage of compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors must be declared            before being used.</p><p><b>`-print-objc-runtime-info`</b>            Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by value, if any.</p><p>Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting <code> Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can  use  the  options  described  below  to  control  the  formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not honor these options. </code></p><p><b>`-fmessage-length`</b>=n            Try  to  format  error messages so that they fit on lines of about n characters.  If n is zero, then no line-wrapping is done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is the default            for all front ends.</p><p>Note - this option also affects the display of the #error and #warning pre-processor directives, and the deprecated function/type/variable attribute.

Instructs  the  diagnostic  messages reporter to emit source location information once; that is, in case the message is too long to fit on a single            physical line and has to be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again, over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default behavior.</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-show-location`</b>=every-line            Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as prefix) for physical lines that result from the  process  of            breaking a message which is too long to fit on a single line.</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-color`</b>[=WHEN]        <b>`-fno-diagnostics-color`</b>            Use  color  in  diagnostics.   WHEN is never, always, or auto.  The default depends on how the compiler has been configured, it can be any of the above WHEN options or also never if GCC_COLORS            environment variable isn't present in the environment, and auto otherwise.  auto makes GCC use color only when the standard error is a terminal, and when not executing in an emacs shell.   The            forms -fdiagnostics-color and -fno-diagnostics-color are aliases for -fdiagnostics-color=always and -fdiagnostics-color=never, respectively.</p><p>The  colors are defined by the environment variable GCC_COLORS.  Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR commands are interpreted            by the terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as character attributes.)  These substring values are            integers in decimal representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.  Common values to concatenate include 1 for bold, 4 for underline, 5 for  blink,  7  for  inverse,  39  for  default            foreground color, 30 to 37 for foreground colors, 90 to 97 for 16-color mode foreground colors, 38;5;0 to 38;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, 49 for default background            color, 40 to 47 for background colors, 100 to 107 for 16-color mode background colors, and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.</p><p>The default GCC_COLORS is</p><p>error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:range1=32:range2=34:locus=01:\                    quote=01:path=01;36:fixit-insert=32:fixit-delete=31:\                    diff-filename=01:diff-hunk=32:diff-delete=31:diff-insert=32:\                    type-diff=01;32:fnname=01;32:targs=35</p><p>where  01;31  is  bold  red,  01;35 is bold magenta, 01;36 is bold cyan, 32 is green, 34 is blue, 01 is bold, and 31 is red.

It can be any of the above WHEN options.</p><p>GCC  can  also  be  configured  (via  the  --with-diagnostics-urls=auto-if-env configure-time option) so that the default is affected by environment variables.  Under such a configuration, GCC            defaults to using auto if either GCC_URLS or TERM_URLS environment variables are present and non-empty in the environment of the compiler, or never if neither are.</p><p>However, even with -fdiagnostics-urls=always the behavior is dependent on those environment variables: If GCC_URLS is set to empty or no, do not embed URLs in diagnostics.  If set to st,  URLs            use  ST  escape  sequences.   If  set  to bel, the default, URLs use BEL escape sequences.  Any other non-empty value enables the feature.  If GCC_URLS is not set, use TERM_URLS as a fallback.            Note: ST is an ANSI escape sequence, string terminator ESC \, BEL is an ASCII character, CTRL-G that usually sounds like a beep.</p><p>At this time GCC tries to detect also a few terminals that are known to not implement the URL feature, and have bugs or at least had bugs in some versions that are still in use, where the  URL            escapes  are  likely  to  misbehave,  i.e. print garbage on the screen.  That list is currently xfce4-terminal, certain known to be buggy gnome-terminal versions, the linux console, and mingw.            This check can be skipped with the -fdiagnostics-urls=always.</p><p><b>`-fno-diagnostics-show-option`</b>            By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying            the -fno-diagnostics-show-option flag suppresses that behavior.</p><p><b>`-fno-diagnostics-show-caret`</b>            By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line and a caret ^ indicating the column.  This option suppresses  this  information.   The  source  line  is  truncated  to  n            characters,  if the -fmessage-length=n option is given.  When the output is done to the terminal, the width is limited to the width given by the COLUMNS environment variable or, if not set, to            the terminal width.</p><p><b>`-fno-diagnostics-show-labels`</b>            By default, when printing source code (via -fdiagnostics-show-caret), diagnostics can label ranges of source code with pertinent information, such as the types of expressions:</p><p>printf ("foo %s bar", long_i + long_j);                                     ~^       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                      |              |                                      char *         long int</p><p>This option suppresses the printing of these labels (in the example above, the vertical bars and the "char *" and "long int" text).</p><p><b>`-fno-diagnostics-show-cwe`</b>            Diagnostic messages can optionally have an associated             CWE ("https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html") identifier.  GCC itself only provides such metadata for some of the -fanalyzer diagnostics.  GCC  plugins  may  also  provide  diagnostics  with  such            metadata.  By default, if this information is present, it will be printed with the diagnostic.  This option suppresses the printing of this metadata.</p><p><b>`-fno-diagnostics-show-rules`</b>            Diagnostic messages can optionally have rules associated with them, such as from a coding standard, or a specification.  GCC itself does not do this for any of its diagnostics, but plugins may            do so.  By default, if this information is present, it will be printed with the diagnostic.

For each fix-it, a line will be printed after the relevant diagnostic, starting with the string "fix-it:".            For example:</p><p>fix-it:"test.c":{45:3-45:21}:"gtk_widget_show_all"</p><p>The location is expressed as a half-open range, expressed as a count of bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.  In the above example, bytes 3 through 20 of line 45 of  "test.c"  are            to be replaced with the given string:</p><p>00000000011111111112222222222                    12345678901234567890123456789                      gtk_widget_showall (dlg);                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                      gtk_widget_show_all</p><p>The filename and replacement string escape backslash as "\\", tab as "\t", newline as "\n", double quotes as "\"", non-printable characters as octal (e.g. vertical tab as "\013").</p><p>An empty replacement string indicates that the given range is to be removed.  An empty range (e.g. "45:3-45:3") indicates that the string is to be inserted at the given position.</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-generate-patch`</b>            Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after any diagnostics are printed.

</code></pre><p><b>`-fno-show-column`</b>            Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the column numbers, such as dejagnu.</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-column-unit`</b>=UNIT            Select the units for the column number.  This affects traditional diagnostics (in the absence of -fno-show-column), as well as JSON format diagnostics if requested.</p><p>The default UNIT, display, considers the number of display columns occupied by each character.  This may be larger than the number of bytes required to encode the character, in the case of tab            characters, or it may be smaller, in the case of multibyte characters.  For example, the character "GREEK SMALL LETTER PI (U+03C0)" occupies one display column, and its UTF-8 encoding requires            two bytes; the character "SLIGHTLY SMILING FACE (U+1F642)" occupies two display columns, and its UTF-8 encoding requires four bytes.</p><p>Setting UNIT to byte changes the column number to the raw byte count in all cases, as was traditionally output by GCC prior to version 11.1.0.</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-column-origin`</b>=ORIGIN            Select  the  origin  for  column numbers, i.e. the column number assigned to the first column.  The default value of 1 corresponds to traditional GCC behavior and to the GNU style guide.  Some            utilities may perform better with an origin of 0; any non-negative value may be specified.</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-escape-format`</b>=FORMAT            When GCC prints pertinent source lines for a diagnostic it normally attempts to print the source bytes directly.  However, some diagnostics relate to encoding issues in the source  file,  such            as malformed UTF-8, or issues with Unicode normalization.  These diagnostics are flagged so that GCC will escape bytes that are not printable ASCII when printing their pertinent source lines.</p><p>This option controls how such bytes should be escaped.</p><p>The  default  FORMAT,  unicode  displays  Unicode  characters  that  are  not  printable  ASCII in the form <U+XXXX>, and bytes that do not correspond to a Unicode character validly-encoded in            UTF-8-encoded will be displayed as hexadecimal in the form <XX>.</p><p>For example, a source line containing the string before followed by the Unicode character U+03C0 ("GREEK SMALL LETTER PI", with UTF-8 encoding 0xCF 0x80) followed by the  byte  0xBF  (a  stray            UTF-8 trailing byte), followed by the string after will be printed for such a diagnostic as:</p><p>before<U+03C0><BF>after</p><p>Setting FORMAT to bytes will display all non-printable-ASCII bytes in the form <XX>, thus showing the underlying encoding of non-ASCII Unicode characters.  For the example above, the following            will be printed:</p><p>before<CF><80><BF>after</p><p><b>`-fdiagnostics-format`</b>=FORMAT            Select a different format for printing diagnostics.  FORMAT is text, sarif-stderr, sarif-file, json, json-stderr, or json-file.</p><p>The default is text.</p><p>The sarif-stderr and sarif-file formats both emit diagnostics in SARIF Version 2.1.0 format, either to stderr, or to a file named source.sarif, respectively.</p><p>The  json  format  is a synonym for json-stderr.  The json-stderr and json-file formats are identical, apart from where the JSON is emitted to - with the former, the JSON is emitted to stderr,            whereas with json-file it is written to source.gcc.json.</p><p>The emitted JSON consists of a top-level JSON array containing JSON objects representing the diagnostics.  The JSON is emitted as one line, without formatting; the  examples  below  have  been            formatted for clarity.</p><p>Diagnostics can have child diagnostics.

If n is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the            number of error messages produced.  If -Wfatal-errors is also specified, then -Wfatal-errors takes precedence over this option.</p><p><b>`-w  Inhibit`</b> all warning messages.</p><p><b>`-Werror`</b>            Make all warnings into errors.</p><p><b>`-Werror`</b>=            Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning is appended; for example -Werror=switch turns the warnings controlled by -Wswitch  into  errors.   This  switch  takes  a            negative form, to be used to negate -Werror for specific warnings; for example -Wno-error=switch makes -Wswitch warnings not be errors, even when -Werror is in effect.</p><p>The  warning  message for each controllable warning includes the option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with -Werror= and -Wno-error= as described above.  (Printing of            the option in the warning message can be disabled using the -fno-diagnostics-show-option flag.)</p><p>Note that specifying -Werror=foo automatically implies -Wfoo.  However, -Wno-error=foo does not imply anything.</p><p><b>`-Wfatal-errors`</b>            This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error messages.</p><p>` You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with -W, for example -Wimplicit to request warnings on implicit declarations.  Each of these  specific  warning  options  also  has  a negative  form  beginning -Wno- to turn off warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit.  This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further language-specific options also refer to C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.  Additional warnings can be produced by enabling the static analyzer;</p><p>Some options, such as -Wall and -Wextra, turn on other options, such as -Wunused, which may turn on further options, such as -Wunused-value. The combined effect of positive and negative  forms  is that  more  specific  options  have  priority  over less specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options enabled or disabled via pragmas take effect as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.</p><p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g., -Wunknown-warning), GCC emits a diagnostic stating that the option is not recognized.  However, if the -Wno- form is used, the  behavior  is slightly  different:  no diagnostic is produced for -Wno-unknown-warning unless other diagnostics are being produced.  This allows the use of new -Wno- options with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler warns that an unrecognized option is present.</p><p>The effectiveness of some warnings depends on optimizations also being enabled. For example -Wsuggest-final-types is more effective with link-time optimization and some instances of other warnings may not be issued at all unless optimization is enabled.  While optimization in general improves the efficacy of control and data flow sensitive warnings, in some cases it  may  also  cause  false positives. `</p><p><b>`-Wpedantic`</b>        <b>`-pedantic`</b>            Issue  all  the  warnings  demanded  by  strict  ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C,            follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any -std option used.</p><p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without this option (though a rare few require -ansi or a -std option specifying the required  version  of  ISO  C).   However,            without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++ features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.</p><p><b>`-Wpedantic  does`</b>  not cause warning messages for use of the alternate keywords whose names begin and end with __.  This alternate format can also be used to disable warnings for non-ISO __intN ` types, i.e. __intN__.  Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows "__extension__".  However, only system header  files  should  use  these  escape  routes;  application programs should avoid them.</p><p>Some  users  try to use -Wpedantic to check programs for strict ISO C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for which ISO C requires a diagnostic, and some others for which diagnostics have been added.</p><p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would be quite different from  -Wpedantic.   We  don't have plans to support such a feature in the near future.</p><p>Where  the  standard  specified with -std represents a GNU extended dialect of C, such as gnu90 or gnu99, there is a corresponding base standard, the version of ISO C on which the GNU extended dialect is based.  Warnings from -Wpedantic are given where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense for such warnings  to  be  given  only  for  features  not  in  the specified GNU C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be nothing to warn about.) `</p><p><b>`-pedantic-errors`</b>            Give  an  error  whenever  the base standard (see -Wpedantic) requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent            compilation of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not equivalent to -Werror=pedantic, since there are errors enabled by this option and not enabled by  the  latter  and            vice versa.</p><p><b>`-Wall`</b>            This  enables  all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.

When the exact number of bytes written by a format  directive            cannot  be  determined  at  compile-time  it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the level argument and on optimization.  While enabling optimization will in most cases improve the            accuracy of the warning, it may also result in false positives.</p><p><b>`-Wformat-overflow`</b>            <b>`-Wformat-overflow`</b>=1                Level 1 of -Wformat-overflow enabled by -Wformat employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most likely overflow the buffer.  At  this  level,  numeric  arguments  to                format  directives  with  unknown  values  are assumed to have the value of one, and strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known to be bounded to a subrange of                their type, or string arguments whose output is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite set of string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range  that                results  in  the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to "sprintf" below is diagnosed because even with both a and b equal to zero, the terminating NUL character ('\0') appended by                the function to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the warning, though it may not be sufficient                to avoid the overflow.</p><p>void f (int a, int b)                        {                          char buf [13];                          sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);                        }</p><p><b>`-Wformat-overflow`</b>=2                Level 2 warns also about calls that might overflow the destination buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level 2, unknown numeric arguments are  assumed  to  have                the minimum representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose length cannot be assumed to                be bounded either by the directive's precision, or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.</p><p>At  level  2, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but this time because with a equal to a 32-bit "INT_MIN" the first %i directive will write some of its digits beyond the end                of the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased to at least 34  bytes.   GCC  includes                the minimum size of the buffer in an informational note following the warning.</p><p>An  alternative  to  increasing  the  size of the destination buffer is to constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string arguments can be bounded by specifying the                precision in the format directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed to be bounded by less than the precision  of  their  type,  choosing  an  appropriate  length                modifier  to the format specifier will reduce the required buffer size.  For example, if a and b in the example above can be assumed to be within the precision of the "short int" type then                using either the %hi format directive or casting the argument to "short" reduces the maximum required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.</p><p>void f (int a, int b)                        {                          char buf [23];                          sprintf (buf, "a = %hi, b = %i\n", a, (short)b);                        }</p><p><b>`-Wno-format-zero-length`</b>            If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.

At present, this warns about calls to "printf" and "scanf"  functions  where  the            format  string  is  not  a string literal and there are no format arguments, as in "printf (foo);".  This may be a security hole if the format string came from untrusted input and contains %n.

This is different from the -Wattributes option in that it warns whenever the compiler decides to drop an attribute, not that the            attribute is either unknown, used in a wrong place, etc.  This warning is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wmain`</b>            Warn if the type of "main" is suspicious.  "main" should be a function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate  types.   This            warning is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by either -Wall or -Wpedantic.</p><p><b>`-Wmisleading-indentation`</b> (C and C++ only)            Warn  when  the indentation of the code does not reflect the block structure.  Specifically, a warning is issued for "if", "else", "while", and "for" clauses with a guarded statement that does            not use braces, followed by an unguarded statement with the same indentation.</p><p>In the following example, the call to "bar" is misleadingly indented as if it were guarded by the "if" conditional.</p><p>if (some_condition ())                        foo ();                        bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the "if".  */</p><p>In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the -ftabstop= option to determine if the statements line up (defaulting to 8).</p><p>The warning is not issued for code involving multiline preprocessor logic such as the following example.</p><p>if (flagA)                        foo (0);                    #if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD                      if (flagB)                    #endif                        foo (1);</p><p>The warning is not issued after a "#line" directive, since this typically indicates autogenerated code, and no assumptions can be  made  about  the  layout  of  the  file  that  the  directive            references.</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall in C and C++.</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-attributes`</b>            Warn  when  a  declaration  of  a  function  is  missing one or more attributes that a related function is declared with and whose absence may adversely affect the correctness or efficiency of            generated code.  For example, the warning is issued for declarations of aliases that use attributes to specify less restrictive requirements  than  those  of  their  targets.   This  typically            represents  a  potential optimization opportunity.  By contrast, the -Wattribute-alias=2 option controls warnings issued when the alias is more restrictive than the target, which could lead to            incorrect code generation.  Attributes considered include "alloc_align", "alloc_size", "cold", "const", "hot", "leaf", "malloc", "nonnull", "noreturn",  "nothrow",  "pure",  "returns_nonnull",            and "returns_twice".</p><p>In  C++, the warning is issued when an explicit specialization of a primary template declared with attribute "alloc_align", "alloc_size", "assume_aligned", "format", "format_arg", "malloc", or            "nonnull" is declared without it.  Attributes "deprecated", "error", and "warning" suppress the warning..</p><p>You can use the "copy" attribute to apply the same set of attributes to a declaration as that on another declaration without explicitly  enumerating  the  attributes.  This  attribute  can  be            applied to declarations of functions, variables, or types.</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-attributes is`</b> enabled by -Wall.</p><p>` For  example,  since the declaration of the primary function template below makes use of both attribute "malloc" and "alloc_size" the declaration of the explicit specialization of the template is diagnosed because it is missing one of the attributes.</p><p>template <class T>         T* __attribute__ ((malloc, alloc_size (1)))         allocate (size_t);</p><p>template <>         void* __attribute__ ((malloc))   // missing alloc_size         allocate<void> (size_t); `</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-braces`</b>            Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.

For Fortran, it  is  partially  enabled  by  default  by            warning for -I and -J, only.</p><p><b>`-Wno-missing-profile`</b>            This  option  controls  warnings  if  feedback  profiles are missing when using the -fprofile-use option.  This option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is added between            compiling with -fprofile-generate and with -fprofile-use, without regenerating the profiles.  In these cases, the profile feedback data files do not contain any  profile  feedback  information            for  the  newly added function or file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile count data (.gcda) files are removed, GCC cannot use any profile feedback information.  In all these cases,            warnings are issued to inform you that a profile generation step is due.  Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized code.  -Wno-missing-profile can be used to  disable  the  warning,            but this is not recommended and should be done only when non-existent profile data is justified.</p><p><b>`-Wmismatched-dealloc`</b>            Warn  for  calls  to  deallocation  functions  with  pointer  arguments  returned from from allocations functions for which the former isn't a suitable deallocator.  A pair of functions can be            associated as matching allocators and deallocators by use of attribute "malloc".  Unless disabled by the -fno-builtin option the standard functions "calloc", "malloc", "realloc",  and  "free",            as  well  as the corresponding forms of C++ "operator new" and "operator delete" are implicitly associated as matching allocators and deallocators.  In the following example "mydealloc" is the            deallocator for pointers returned from "myalloc".</p><p>void mydealloc (void*);</p><p>__attribute__ ((malloc (mydealloc, 1))) void*                    myalloc (size_t);</p><p>void f (void)                    {                      void *p = myalloc (32);                      // ...use p...                      free (p);   // warning: not a matching deallocator for myalloc                      mydealloc (p);   // ok                    }</p><p>In C++, the related option -Wmismatched-new-delete diagnoses mismatches involving either "operator new" or "operator delete".</p><p>Option -Wmismatched-dealloc is included in -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wmultistatement-macros`</b>            Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be guarded by a clause such as "if", "else", "for", "switch", or "while", in which only the first statement is actually guarded after            the macro is expanded.</p><p>For example:</p><p>#define DOIT x++; y++                    if (c)                      DOIT;</p><p>will increment "y" unconditionally, not just when "c" holds.

When the condition in the "?": operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is always 1.  Often            programmers expect it to be a value computed inside the conditional expression instead.</p><p>For C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead of a declaration:</p><p>{                      // Declares a local variable called mymutex.                      std::unique_lock<std::mutex> (mymutex);                      // User meant std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock (mymutex);                    }</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wno-self-move`</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)            This warning warns when a value is moved to itself with "std::move".

These occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a larger expression), after            the evaluation of the first operand of a "&&", "||", "? :" or "," (comma) operator, before a function is called (but after the evaluation of its  arguments  and  the  expression  denoting  the            called  function),  and  in  certain other places.  Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All these            rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order, since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression with no sequence point between them, the order in which the            functions are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have ruled that function calls do not overlap.</p><p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this have undefined behavior; the C and  C++  standards            specify  that  "Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore, the prior value shall            be read only to determine the value to be stored.".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.</p><p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are "a = a++;", "a[n] = b[n++]" and "a[i++] = i;".  Some more complicated cases are not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an  occasional  false            positive result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting this sort of problem in programs.</p><p>The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so            the above examples are no longer undefined.  But this option will still warn about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C and earlier revisions of C++.</p><p>The  standard  is  worded  confusingly,  therefore  there  is  some debate over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

Annotating the function with attribute "access (none)" indicates that the argument isn't used to access the object and avoids the warning.</p><p>These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise GCC does not keep track of the state of variables.</p><p>These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able to determine when the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.

To suppress the warning, you need to provide a default case with <a href="./assert.html">assert(0)</a> or similar code.</p><p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to "longjmp".  The compiler sees only the calls to "setjmp".  It cannot know where  "longjmp"  will  be            called;  in  fact, a signal handler could call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning even when there is in fact no problem because "longjmp" cannot in fact be called            at the place that would cause a problem.</p><p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions you use that never return as "noreturn".</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall or -Wextra.</p><p><b>`-Wunknown-pragmas`</b>            Warn when a "#pragma" directive is encountered that is not understood by GCC.

The priority values must be greater than 100 as the compiler reserves priority values between 0--100 for the            implementation.</p><p><b>`-Wstrict-aliasing`</b>            This option is only active when -fstrict-aliasing is active.

Warns about incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.</p><p>Level  3  (default  for  -Wstrict-aliasing):  Should have very few false positives and few false negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.  Takes care of the            common pun+dereference pattern in the front end: "*(int*)&some_float".  If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals  with  multiple  statement  cases  using  flow-            sensitive points-to information.

It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does            not warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus this warning depends on the optimization level.</p><p>An  optimization  that  assumes that signed overflow does not occur is perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this            warning can easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several warning levels are defined.

For example: "abs (x) >= 0".  This can only be simplified when signed integer overflow  is  undefined,  because                "abs (INT_MIN)" overflows to "INT_MIN", which is less than zero.  -Wstrict-overflow (with no level) is the same as -Wstrict-overflow=2.</p><p><b>`-Wstrict-overflow`</b>=3                Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.

For example: "x + 2 > y" is simplified to "x + 1 >= y".  This is reported only at                the highest warning level because this simplification applies to many comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of false positives.</p><p><b>`-Wstring-compare`</b>            Warn for calls to "strcmp" and "strncmp" whose result is determined to be either zero or non-zero in tests for such equality owing to the length of one argument being greater than the size  of            the  array  the  other argument is stored in (or the bound in the case of "strncmp").

The optional argument is one greater  than  the  type  of            Object  Size Checking to perform to determine the size of the destination.  The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays but not for raw memory functions like            "memcpy" which always make use of Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size in excess of the largest possible object or at most "SIZE_MAX / 2" bytes.

A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run time on the stack when the address of a nested function            is taken, and is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for most targets, it  is  made  up  of            code and thus requires the stack to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.</p><p><b>`-Wfloat-equal`</b>            Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.</p><p>The  idea  behind  this  is that sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this,            then you need to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it when  performing  comparisons  (and            when  producing  output,  but that's a different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and this is            done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably mistaken.</p><p><b>`-Wtraditional`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C  equivalent,  and/or  problematic  constructs  that            should be avoided.</p><p>*   Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.  In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals, but in ISO C it does not.</p><p>*   In  traditional  C,  some  preprocessor  directives did not exist.  Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive if the # appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore                <b>`-Wtraditional warns`</b> about directives that traditional C understands but ignores because the # does not appear as the first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like <code> "#pragma" not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some traditional implementations do not recognize "#elif", so this option suggests avoiding it altogether. </code></p><p>*   A function-like macro that appears without arguments.</p><p>*   The unary plus operator.</p><p>*   The U integer constant suffix, or the F or L floating-point constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the L suffix on integer constants.)   Note,  these  suffixes  appear  in  macros                defined  in  the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the _MIN/_MAX macros in "<limits.h>".  Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCC's                integrated preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these cases.</p><p>*   A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of the block.</p><p>*   A "switch" statement has an operand of type "long".</p><p>*   A non-"static" function declaration follows a "static" one.  This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.</p><p>*   The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if the base of the constant is  ten.   I.e.  hexadecimal  or                octal values, which typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.</p><p>*   Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.</p><p>*   Initialization of automatic aggregates.</p><p>*   Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate namespace for labels.</p><p>*   Initialization  of  unions.   If  the  initializer  is  zero,  the warning is omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in user code appears conditioned on e.g.                "__STDC__" to avoid missing initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the traditional C case.</p><p>*   Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional C causes serious problems.  This is a  subset                of the possible conversion warnings; for the full set use -Wtraditional-conversion.</p><p>*   Use  of  ISO  C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is not issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions because these ISO C features appear in your code when                using libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, "PARAMS" and "VPARAMS".  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions because that feature is already a GCC extension  and  thus                not relevant to traditional C compatibility.</p><p><b>`-Wtraditional-conversion`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn  if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating            and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument except when the same as the default promotion.</p><p><b>`-Wdeclaration-after-statement`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This construct, known from C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90.</p><p><b>`-Wshadow`</b>            Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable, parameter, type, class member (in C++), or instance variable (in Objective-C) or whenever a  built-in  function  is            shadowed.   Note  that  in C++, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum.  If this warning is enabled, it includes also all            instances of local shadowing.  This means that -Wno-shadow=local and -Wno-shadow=compatible-local are ignored when -Wshadow is used.  Same as -Wshadow=global.</p><p><b>`-Wno-shadow-ivar`</b> (Objective-C only)            Do not warn whenever a local variable shadows an instance variable in an Objective-C method.</p><p><b>`-Wshadow`</b>=global            Warn for any shadowing.  Same as -Wshadow.</p><p><b>`-Wshadow`</b>=local            Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter.</p><p><b>`-Wshadow`</b>=compatible-local            Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable.  In C++, type compatibility here  means  the  type  of  the            shadowing variable can be converted to that of the shadowed variable.  The creation of this flag (in addition to -Wshadow=local) is based on the idea that when a local variable shadows another            one of incompatible type, it is most likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:</p><p>for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)                    {                      for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)                      {                        ...                      }                      ...                    }</p><p>Since the two variable "i" in the example above have incompatible types, enabling only -Wshadow=compatible-local does not emit a warning.  Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer            accidentally uses one in place of the other, type checking is expected to catch that and emit an error or warning.  Use of this flag instead of -Wshadow=local can possibly reduce the number of            warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.  Note that this also means that shadowing "const char *i" by "char *i" does not emit a warning.</p><p>This warning is also enabled by -Wshadow=local.</p><p><b>`-Wlarger-than`</b>=byte-size            Warn whenever an object is defined whose size exceeds byte-size.  -Wlarger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX is enabled by default.

For example, calling abs(3.14) triggers the warning            because the appropriate function to call to compute the absolute value of a double argument is "fabs".  The option also triggers warnings when the argument in a call to such a function has  an            unsigned type.

For example, warn if a "const char *" is cast to an ordinary "char *".</p><p>Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an unsafe way.  For example, casting "char <b>" to "const char </b>" is unsafe, as in this example:</p><p>/* p is char <b> value.  */                      const char </b>q = (const char <b>) p;                      /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */                      *q = "string";                      /* Now char</b> pointer points to read-only memory.  */                      **p = 'b';</p><p><b>`-Wcast-align`</b>            Warn  whenever  a  pointer  is  cast  such that the required alignment of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a "char *" is cast to an "int *" on machines where integers can only be            accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.</p><p><b>`-Wcast-align`</b>=strict            Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a "char *" is cast to an "int *" regardless of the target machine.</p><p><b>`-Wcast-function-type`</b>            Warn when a function pointer is cast to an incompatible function pointer.  In a cast involving function types with a variable argument list  only  the  types  of  initial  arguments  that  are            provided are considered.  Any parameter of pointer-type matches any other pointer-type.  Any benign differences in integral types are ignored, like "int" vs. "long" on ILP32 targets.  Likewise            type  qualifiers  are  ignored.  The function type "void (*) (void)" is special and matches everything, which can be used to suppress this warning.  In a cast involving pointer to member types            this warning warns whenever the type cast is changing the pointer to member type.  This warning is enabled by -Wextra.</p><p><b>`-Wwrite-strings`</b>            When compiling C, give string constants the type "const char[length]" so that copying the address of one into a non-"const" "char *" pointer produces a warning.  These warnings help  you  find            at compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about using "const" in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is just a nuisance.            This is why we did not make -Wall request these warnings.</p><p>When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from string literals to "char *".  This warning is enabled by default for C++ programs.</p><p><b>`-Wclobbered`</b>            Warn for variables that might be changed by "longjmp" or "vfork".  This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p><p><b>`-Wno-complain-wrong-lang`</b>            By  default, language front ends complain when a command-line option is valid, but not applicable to that front end.  This may be disabled with -Wno-complain-wrong-lang, which is mostly useful            when invoking a single compiler driver for multiple source files written in different languages, for example:</p><p>$ g++ -fno-rtti a.cc b.f90</p><p>The driver g++ invokes the C++ front end to compile a.cc and the Fortran front end to compile b.f90.

Do not warn for explicit casts like "abs ((int) x)" and "ui = (unsigned) -1", or if the value is not changed by the            conversion like in "abs (2.0)".  Warnings about conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by using -Wno-sign-conversion.</p><p>For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined conversions; and conversions that never use a type conversion operator: conversions to "void", the same type, a base class            or a reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and unsigned integers are disabled by default in C++ unless -Wsign-conversion is explicitly enabled.</p><p>Warnings about conversion from arithmetic on a small type back to that type are only given with -Warith-conversion.</p><p><b>`-Wdangling-else`</b>            Warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which "if" statement an "else" branch belongs.  Here is an example of such a case:</p><p>{                      if (a)                        if (b)                          foo ();                      else                        bar ();                    }</p><p>In C/C++, every "else" branch belongs to the innermost possible "if" statement, which in this example is "if (b)".  This is often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the  above            example  by  indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces            around the innermost "if" statement so there is no way the "else" can belong to the enclosing "if".  The resulting code looks like this:</p><p>{                      if (a)                        {                          if (b)                            foo ();                          else                            bar ();                        }                    }</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wparentheses.</p><p><b>`-Wdangling-pointer`</b>        <b>`-Wdangling-pointer`</b>=n            Warn about uses of pointers (or C++ references) to objects with automatic storage duration after their lifetime has ended.

This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess`</b>            Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory built-in functions if the argument uses "sizeof".  This warning triggers for example for "memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));"  if            "ptr"  is  not  an  array,  but a pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about "memcpy (&foo, ptr, sizeof (&foo));".  -Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess also warns about calls to bounded string copy            functions like "strncat" or "strncpy" that specify as the bound a "sizeof" expression of the source array.  For example, in the following function the call to "strncat" specifies the  size  of            the source string as the bound.

This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.</p><p><b>`-Wmemset-elt-size`</b>            Warn for suspicious calls to the "memset" built-in function, if the first argument references an array, and the third argument is a number equal to the number of elements, but not equal to the            size of the array in memory.  This indicates that the user has omitted a multiplication by the element size.  This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wmemset-transposed-args`</b>            Warn  for  suspicious  calls  to  the  "memset"  built-in function where the second argument is not zero and the third argument is zero.  For example, the call "memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)" is            diagnosed because "memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)" was meant instead.  The diagnostic is only emitted if the third argument is a literal zero.  Otherwise, if it is an expression that is folded to            zero, or a cast of zero to some type, it is far less likely that the arguments have been mistakenly transposed and no warning is emitted.

These include comparing the address of a function or a declared object to the null pointer constant such as in</p><p>void f (void);                    void g (void)                    {                      if (!f)   // warning: expression evaluates to false                        abort ();                    }</p><p>comparisons of a pointer to a string literal, such as in</p><p>void f (const char *x)                    {                      if (x == "abc")   // warning: expression evaluates to false                        puts ("equal");                    }</p><p>and tests of the results of pointer addition or subtraction for equality to null, such as in</p><p>void f (const int *p, int i)                    {                      return p + i == NULL;                    }</p><p>Such uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of most functions and objects necessarily evaluates to true (the exception are weak symbols), so their use in a  conditional  might            indicate missing parentheses in a function call or a missing dereference in an array expression.  The subset of the warning for object pointers can be suppressed by casting the pointer operand            to  an  integer  type  such as "intptr_t" or "uintptr_t".  Comparisons against string literals result in unspecified behavior and are not portable, and suggest the intent was to call "strcmp".            The warning is suppressed if the suspicious expression is the result of macro expansion.  -Waddress warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wno-address-of-packed-member`</b>            Do not warn when the address of packed member of struct or union is taken, which usually results in an unaligned pointer value.  This is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wlogical-op`</b>            Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.  This includes using logical operators in contexts where a bit-wise operator is likely to be  expected.   Also  warns  when  the            operands of a logical operator are the same:</p><p>extern int a;                    if (a < 0 && a < 0) { ... }</p><p><b>`-Wlogical-not-parentheses`</b>            Warn  about  logical not used on the left hand side operand of a comparison.  This option does not warn if the right operand is considered to be a boolean expression.  Its purpose is to detect            suspicious code like the following:</p><p>int a;                    ...                    if (!a > 1) { ... }</p><p>It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the LHS into parentheses:</p><p>if ((!a) > 1) { ... }</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Waggregate-return`</b>            Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits a warning.)</p><p><b>`-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations`</b>            Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the compiler detects undefined behavior in some statement during one or more of the iterations.</p><p><b>`-Wno-attributes`</b>            Do not warn if an unexpected "__attribute__" is used, such as unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables, etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use of  supported            attributes.</p><p>Additionally,  using -Wno-attributes=, it is possible to suppress warnings about unknown scoped attributes (in C++11 and C2X).  For example, -Wno-attributes=vendor::attr disables warning about            the following declaration:</p><p>[[vendor::attr]] void f();</p><p>It is also possible to disable warning about all attributes in a namespace using -Wno-attributes=vendor:: which prevents warning about both of these declarations:</p><p>[[vendor::safe]] void f();                    [[vendor::unsafe]] void f2();</p><p>Note that -Wno-attributes= does not imply -Wno-attributes.</p><p><b>`-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch`</b>            Warn if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible signature or as a non-function, or when a built-in function declared with a type that does not include a prototype is  called  with            arguments whose promoted types do not match those expected by the function.  When -Wextra is specified, also warn when a built-in function that takes arguments is declared without a prototype.            The -Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch warning is enabled by default.  To avoid the warning include the appropriate header to bring the prototypes of built-in functions into scope.</p><p>For  example,  the  call  to  "memset"  below  is diagnosed by the warning because the function expects a value of type "size_t" as its argument but the type of 32 is "int".  With -Wextra, the            declaration of the function is diagnosed as well.</p><p>extern void* memset ();                    void f (void *d)                    {                      memset (d, '\0', 32);                    }</p><p><b>`-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined`</b>            Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses warnings for redefinition of "__TIMESTAMP__", "__TIME__", "__DATE__", "__FILE__", and "__BASE_FILE__".</p><p><b>`-Wstrict-prototypes`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without a warning if preceded by a declaration  that  specifies            the argument types.)</p><p><b>`-Wold-style-declaration`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like "static" are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning            is also enabled by -Wextra.</p><p><b>`-Wold-style-definition`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn  if  an  old-style  function  definition  is used.  A warning is given even if there is a previous prototype.  A definition using () is not considered an old-style definition in C2X mode,            because it is equivalent to (void) in that case, but is considered an old-style definition for older standards.</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-parameter-type`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&R-style functions:</p><p>void foo(bar) { }</p><p>This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-prototypes`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself provides a prototype.  Use this  option  to  detect  global            functions  that  do  not  have  a  matching  prototype  declaration  in a header file.  This option is not valid for C++ because all function declarations provide prototypes and a non-matching            declaration declares an overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.  Use -Wmissing-declarations to detect missing declarations in C++.</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-declarations`</b>            Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.  Use this  option  to  detect  global  functions  that  are  not            declared  in header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous non-prototype declarations; use -Wmissing-prototypes to detect missing prototypes.  In C++, no warnings are            issued for function templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.</p><p><b>`-Wmissing-field-initializers`</b>            Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For example, the following code causes such a warning, because "x.h" is implicitly zero:</p><p>struct s { int f, g, h; };                    struct s x = { 3, 4 };</p><p>This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following modification does not trigger a warning:</p><p>struct s { int f, g, h; };                    struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };</p><p>In C this option does not warn about the universal zero initializer { 0 }:</p><p>struct s { int f, g, h; };                    struct s x = { 0 };</p><p>Likewise, in C++ this option does not warn about the empty { } initializer, for example:</p><p>struct s { int f, g, h; };                    s x = { };</p><p>This warning is included in -Wextra.  To get other -Wextra warnings without this one, use -Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers.</p><p><b>`-Wno-missing-requires`</b>            By default, the compiler warns about a concept-id appearing as a C++20 simple-requirement:</p><p>bool satisfied = requires { C<T> };</p><p>Here satisfied will be true if C<T> is a valid expression, which it is for all T.  Presumably the user meant to write</p><p>bool satisfied = requires { requires C<T> };</p><p>so satisfied is only true if concept C is satisfied for type T.</p><p>This warning can be disabled with -Wno-missing-requires.</p><p><b>`-Wno-missing-template-keyword`</b>            The member access tokens ., -> and :: must be followed by the "template" keyword if the parent object is dependent and the member being named is a template.</p><p>template <class X>                    void DoStuff (X x)                    {                      x.template DoSomeOtherStuff<X>(); // Good.                      x.DoMoreStuff<X>(); // Warning, x is dependent.                    }</p><p>In rare cases it is possible to get false positives. To silence this, wrap the expression in parentheses. For example, the following is treated as a template, even where m and N are integers:</p><p>void NotATemplate (my_class t)                    {                      int N = 5;</p><p>bool test = t.m < N > (0); // Treated as a template.                      test = (t.m < N) > (0); // Same meaning, but not treated as a template.                    }</p><p>This warning can be disabled with -Wno-missing-template-keyword.</p><p><b>`-Wno-multichar`</b>            Do not warn if a multicharacter constant ('FOOF') is used.  Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have implementation-defined values, and should  not  be  used  in  portable            code.</p><p><b>`-Wnormalized`</b>=[none|id|nfc|nfkc]            In  ISO  C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can            have two different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard sets out some normalization rules which when applied ensure that two sequences that  look            the same are turned into the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.</p><p>There  are  four  levels  of  warning  supported  by  GCC.  The default is -Wnormalized=nfc, which warns about any identifier that is not in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, NFC.  NFC is the            recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to -Wnormalized.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use  these  symbols            in  portable  ISO  C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.  -Wnormalized=id suppresses the warning for these characters.  It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will            correct this, which is why this option is not the default.</p><p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing -Wnormalized=none or -Wno-normalized.  You should only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like "D"), because            otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.</p><p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has been applied.  For instance "\u207F", "SUPERSCRIPT            LATIN SMALL LETTER N", displays just like a regular "n" that has been placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the NFKC normalization scheme to convert all these into  a  standard  form  as            well,  and  GCC  warns  if  your  code is not in NFKC if you use -Wnormalized=nfkc.  This warning is comparable to warning about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be            confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.</p><p><b>`-Wno-attribute-warning`</b>            Do not warn about usage  of  functions  declared  with  "warning"  attribute.   By  default,  this  warning  is  enabled.   -Wno-attribute-warning  can  be  used  to  disable  the  warning  or            <b>`-Wno-error`</b>=attribute-warning can be used to disable the error when compiled with -Werror flag.</p><p><b>`-Wno-deprecated`</b>            Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.</p><p><b>`-Wno-deprecated-declarations`</b>            Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the "deprecated" attribute.</p><p><b>`-Wno-overflow`</b>            Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.</p><p><b>`-Wno-odr`</b>            Warn about One Definition Rule violations during link-time optimization.  Enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wopenacc-parallelism`</b>            Warn about potentially suboptimal choices related to OpenACC parallelism.</p><p><b>`-Wopenmp-simd`</b>            Warn if the vectorizer cost model overrides the OpenMP simd directive set by user.  The -fsimd-cost-model=unlimited option can be used to relax the cost model.</p><p><b>`-Woverride-init`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when using designated initializers.</p><p>This warning is included in -Wextra.  To get other -Wextra warnings without this one, use -Wextra -Wno-override-init.</p><p><b>`-Wno-override-init-side-effects`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Do not warn if an initialized field with side effects is overridden when using designated initializers.  This warning is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-Wpacked`</b>            Warn  if  a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.  Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For            instance, in this code, the variable "f.x" in "struct bar" is misaligned even though "struct bar" does not itself have the packed attribute:</p><p>struct foo {                      int x;                      char a, b, c, d;                    } __attribute__((packed));                    struct bar {                      char z;                      struct foo f;                    };</p><p><b>`-Wnopacked-bitfield-compat`</b>            The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the "packed" attribute on bit-fields of type "char".  This was fixed in GCC 4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the structure  layout.   GCC            informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.  For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field "a" and "b" in this structure:</p><p>struct foo                    {                      char a:4;                      char b:8;                    } __attribute__ ((packed));</p><p>This warning is enabled by default.  Use -Wno-packed-bitfield-compat to disable this warning.</p><p><b>`-Wpacked-not-aligned`</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)            Warn  if  a  structure field with explicitly specified alignment in a packed struct or union is misaligned.  For example, a warning will be issued on "struct S", like, "warning: alignment 1 of            'struct S' is less than 8", in this code:</p><p>struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) S8 { char a[8]; };                    struct __attribute__ ((packed)) S {                      struct S8 s8;                    };</p><p>This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wpadded`</b>            Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this happens it is possible to rearrange the fields  of            the structure to reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.</p><p><b>`-Wredundant-decls`</b>            Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.</p><p><b>`-Wrestrict`</b>            Warn when an object referenced by a "restrict"-qualified parameter (or, in C++, a "__restrict"-qualified parameter) is aliased by another argument, or when copies between such objects overlap.            For  example,  the call to the "strcpy" function below attempts to truncate the string by replacing its initial characters with the last four.  However, because the call writes the terminating            NUL into "a[4]", the copies overlap and the call is diagnosed.</p><p>void foo (void)                    {                      char a[] = "abcd1234";                      strcpy (a, a + 4);                      ...                    }</p><p>The -Wrestrict option detects some instances of simple overlap even without optimization but works best at -O2 and above.  It is included in -Wall.</p><p><b>`-Wnested-externs`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Warn if an "extern" declaration is encountered within a function.</p><p><b>`-Winline`</b>            Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.  Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to inline functions declared in system headers.</p><p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the  amount            of  inlining  that  has  already  been  done in the current function.  Therefore, seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by -Winline to appear or            disappear.</p><p><b>`-Winterference-size`</b>            Warn about use of C++17 "std::hardware_destructive_interference_size" without specifying its value with --param destructive-interference-size.  Also warn about  questionable  values  for  that            option.</p><p>This variable is intended to be used for controlling class layout, to avoid false sharing in concurrent code:</p><p>struct independent_fields {                      alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size)                        std::atomic<int> one;                      alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size)                        std::atomic<int> two;                    };</p><p>Here one and two are intended to be far enough apart that stores to one won't require accesses to the other to reload the cache line.</p><p>By  default, --param destructive-interference-size and --param constructive-interference-size are set based on the current -mtune option, typically to the L1 cache line size for the particular            target CPU, sometimes to a range if tuning for a generic target.  So all translation units that depend on ABI compatibility for the use of these variables must be compiled with the same -mtune            (or -mcpu).</p><p>If ABI stability is important, such as if the use is in a header for a library, you should probably not use the hardware interference size variables at all.  Alternatively,  you  can  force  a            particular value with --param.</p><p>If you are confident that your use of the variable does not affect ABI outside a single build of your project, you can turn off the warning with -Wno-interference-size.</p><p><b>`-Wint-in-bool-context`</b>            Warn for suspicious use of integer values where boolean values are expected, such as conditional expressions (?:) using non-boolean integer constants in boolean context, like "if (a <= b ? 2 :            3)".  Or left shifting of signed integers in boolean context, like "for (a = 0; 1 << a; a++);".  Likewise for all kinds of multiplications regardless of the data type.

Mainly useful for the performance tuning.  Vector operation can be implemented "piecewise", which  means            that  the  scalar  operation  is  performed  on  every  vector  element; "in parallel", which means that the vector operation is implemented using scalars of wider type, which normally is more            performance efficient; and "as a single scalar", which means that vector fits into a scalar type.</p><p><b>`-Wvla`</b>            Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.  -Wno-vla prevents the -Wpedantic warning of the variable-length array.</p><p><b>`-Wvla-larger-than`</b>=byte-size            If this option is used, the compiler warns for declarations of variable-length arrays whose size is either unbounded, or bounded by an argument that allows the array size to  exceed  byte-size            bytes.

Failing to provide arguments of sufficient size or accessing more than the maximum number of elements may be diagnosed.</p><p>For  example, the warning triggers for the following redeclarations because the first one allows an array of any size to be passed to "f" while the second one specifies that the array argument            must have at least "n" elements.  In addition, calling "f" with the associated VLA bound parameter in excess of the actual VLA bound triggers a warning as well.</p><p>void f (int n, int[n]);                    // warning: argument 2 previously declared as a VLA                    void f (int, int[]);</p><p>void g (int n)                    {                        if (n > 4)                          return;                        int a[n];                        // warning: access to a by f may be out of bounds                        f (sizeof a, a);                      ...                    }</p><p><b>`-Wvla-parameter is`</b> included in -Wall.

Specifically, the warning occurs when the left-hand side is the decimal constant 2 or 10 and            the right-hand side is also a decimal constant.</p><p>In C and C++, "^" means exclusive or, whereas in some other languages (e.g. TeX and some versions of BASIC) it means exponentiation.</p><p>This warning is enabled by default.  It can be silenced by converting one of the operands to hexadecimal.</p><p><b>`-Wdisabled-optimization`</b>            Warn  if  a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it merely indicates that GCC's optimizers are unable            to handle the code effectively.

Modern compilers generally allow string constants that  are  much  longer  than  the            standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid using longer strings.</p><p>The  limit  applies  after  string  constant concatenation, and does not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a            normative minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.</p><p>This option is implied by -Wpedantic, and can be disabled with -Wno-overlength-strings.</p><p><b>`-Wunsuffixed-float-constants`</b> (C and Objective-C only)            Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have a suffix.

Some debug formats can co-exist (like DWARF with CTF) when each of them is enabled explicitly by adding the respective command line option to your other options.</p><p>GCC allows you to use -g with -O.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may  briefly  move  where you  did  not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant results or their values are already at hand; some statements may execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.  Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output.  This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.</p><p>If you are not using some other optimization option, consider using -Og with -g.  With no -O option at all, some compiler passes that collect information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that -Og may result in a better debugging experience. `</p><p><b>`-g  Produce`</b> debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging information.</p><p>On most systems that use stabs format, -g enables use of extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably  makes  other            debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use -gvms (see below).</p><p><b>`-ggdb`</b>            Produce  debugging  information  for  use  by GDB.  This means to use the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB            extensions if at all possible.</p><p><b>`-gdwarf`</b>        <b>`-gdwarf-version`</b>            Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).  The value of version may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version for  most  targets  is  5  (with  the  exception  of            VxWorks, TPF and Darwin/Mac OS X, which default to version 2, and AIX, which defaults to version 4).</p><p>Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.</p><p>Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and -fvar-tracking-assignments for maximum benefit. Version 5 requires GDB 8.0 or higher.</p><p>GCC no longer supports DWARF Version 1, which is substantially different than Version 2 and later.  For historical reasons, some other DWARF-related options such as -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm) retain            a reference to DWARF Version 2 in their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of DWARF.</p><p><b>`-gbtf`</b>            Request  BTF debug information.  BTF is the default debugging format for the eBPF target.  On other targets, like x86, BTF debug information can be generated along with DWARF debug information            when both of the debug formats are enabled explicitly via their respective command line options.</p><p><b>`-gctf`</b>        <b>`-gctflevel`</b>            Request CTF debug information and use level to specify how much CTF debug information should be produced.  If -gctf is specified without a value for level,  the  default  level  of  CTF  debug            information is 2.</p><p>CTF debug information can be generated along with DWARF debug information when both of the debug formats are enabled explicitly via their respective command line options.</p><p>Level 0 produces no CTF debug information at all.  Thus, -gctf0 negates -gctf.</p><p>Level 1 produces CTF information for tracebacks only.  This includes callsite information, but does not include type information.</p><p>Level 2 produces type information for entities (functions, data objects etc.)  at file-scope or global-scope only.</p><p><b>`-gvms`</b>            Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems.</p><p><b>`-glevel`</b>        <b>`-ggdblevel`</b>        <b>`-gvmslevel`</b>            Request debugging information and also use level to specify how much information.  The default level is 2.</p><p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, -g0 negates -g.</p><p>Level  1  produces  minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and            line number tables, but no information about local variables.</p><p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use -g3.</p><p>If you use multiple -g options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the one that is effective.</p><p><b>`-gdwarf does`</b> not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid confusion with -gdwarf-level.  Instead use an additional -glevel option to change the debug level for DWARF.</p><p><b>`-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols`</b>            By default, no debug information is produced for symbols that are not actually used. Use this option if you want debug information for all symbols.</p><p><b>`-femit-class-debug-always`</b>            Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option should be used only with debuggers that are  unable            to handle the way GCC normally emits debugging information for classes because using this option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a factor of two.</p><p><b>`-fno-merge-debug-strings`</b>            Direct  the  linker  to  not  merge together strings in the debugging information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging            decreases the size of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.</p><p><b>`-fdebug-prefix-map`</b>=old=new            When compiling files residing in directory old, record debugging information describing them as if the files resided in directory new instead.  This can be used to replace  a  build-time  path            with  an install-time path in the debug info.  It can also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using . for new.  This can give more reproducible builds, which are location            independent, but may require an extra command to tell GDB where to find the source files. See also -ffile-prefix-map and -fcanon-prefix-map.</p><p><b>`-fvar-tracking`</b>            Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated (if the debugging information format supports this            information).</p><p>It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (-Os, -O, -O2, ...), debugging information (-g) and the debug info format supports it.</p><p><b>`-fvar-tracking-assignments`</b>            Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in  an  attempt  to  improve  debug            information while optimizing.

In practice, this means that when compiling foo.c, debug            information is generated for types declared in that file and foo.h, but not other header files.

Sometimes it is  useful  to  have  GCC  emit            debugging  information  for all types declared in a compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used in that compilation unit, for example if, in the debugger, you want to            cast a value to a type that is not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often, however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.</p><p>Options That Control Optimization ` These options control various sorts of optimizations.</p><p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.  Statements are independent: if you stop  the  program with  a  breakpoint  between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you expect from the source code.</p><p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.</p><p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows the compiler to use information  gained  from all of the files when compiling each of them.</p><p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.</p><p>Most  optimizations  are  completely  disabled  at  -O0  or  if  an  -O  level  is not set on the command line, even if individual optimization flags are specified.

This assumes that loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for            example  causing  signed  integer  overflows  or out-of-bound array accesses.

For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are clones, which means two copies of the function.

This option enables simple constant folding optimizations at all            optimization levels.  In addition, other optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow analyses that eliminate useless checks for  null  pointers;  these  assume  that  a            memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.</p><p>Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.  Use -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks to disable this optimization for programs that depend on that behavior.</p><p>This option is enabled by default on most targets.

Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call the set of likely  targets.  If  the            set  is  small,  preferably  of size 1, change the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When            they seem useless after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.</p><p><b>`-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans`</b>            Stream extra information needed for aggressive devirtualization when running the link-time optimizer in local transformation mode.  This option enables more devirtualization but  significantly            increases the size of streamed data.

Normally dead store elimination will take advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object storage persisting beyond the            lifetime of the object, you can use this flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears  the  object  storage)  but            still  treat  the  object as dead after the destructor, you can use -flifetime-dse=1.  The default behavior can be explicitly selected with -flifetime-dse=2.  -flifetime-dse=0 is equivalent to            <b>`-fno-lifetime-dse`</b>.</p><p><b>`-flive-range-shrinkage`</b>            Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live range shrinkage.

The algorithm argument can be priority, which specifies Chow's priority coloring, or CB, which  specifies  Chaitin-            Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is the default because it generates better code.</p><p><b>`-fira-region`</b>=region            Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.

While this feature is useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation  functions  by  a            debugging  implementation,  it  is  expensive  in  the terms of code quality.  With -fno-semantic-interposition the compiler assumes that if interposition happens for functions the overwriting            function will have precisely the same semantics (and side effects).

This flag is enabled by default at -O1 and higher.</p><p><b>`-fcode-hoisting`</b>            Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit as early as possible.  This is especially useful  as  a  code  size            optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well.

The  difference  between  FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant            computation.  This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.  This flag is enabled by default at -O1 and higher.</p><p><b>`-ftree-phiprop`</b>            Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.

The functions called only from cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as "cold", "noreturn", static constructors or            destructors) are identified. Cold functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for size.  Enabled by default at -O1 and higher.</p><p><b>`-fipa-modref`</b>            Perform  interprocedural  mod/ref  analysis.

When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning when externally  visible  function            can be called with constant arguments.  Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions, it may significantly increase code size (see --param ipa-cp-unit-growth=value).  This            flag is enabled by default at -O3.

The cheap model disables vectorization of loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise            is  equal  to  the  dynamic  model.   The  very-cheap  model only allows vectorization if the vector code would entirely replace the scalar code that is being vectorized.  For example, if each            iteration of a vectorized loop would only be able to handle exactly four iterations of the scalar loop, the very-cheap model would only allow vectorization if the  scalar  iteration  count  is            known to be a multiple of four.</p><p>The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is either dynamic or cheap.</p><p><b>`-fsimd-cost-model`</b>=model            Alter  the  cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP simd directive.

For C (and C++), this activates optimizations  based  on  the  type  of  expressions.   In            particular,  an  object  of  one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For example, an "unsigned int" can            alias an "int", but not a "void*" or a "double".  A character type may alias any other type.</p><p>Pay special attention to code like this:</p><p>union a_union {                      int i;                      double d;                    };</p><p>int f() {                      union a_union t;                      t.d = 3.0;                      return t.i;                    }</p><p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.

In most cases the precise list of symbols used or exported from the binary is known the resolution info passed to  the  link-time  optimizer  by  the            linker plugin.  It is still useful if no linker plugin is used or during incremental link step when final code is produced (with -flto -flinker-output=nolto-rel).</p><p><b>`-flto`</b>[=n]            This  option  runs  the  standard  link-time optimizer.  When invoked with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the            object file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they had been part of the same translation unit.</p><p>To use the link-time optimizer, -flto and optimization options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.  It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in            the same link with the same options and also specify those options at link time.  For example:</p><p>gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c                    gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c                    gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o</p><p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside foo.o and bar.o.  The final invocation reads  the  GIMPLE  bytecode  from  foo.o  and            bar.o,  merges  the  two  files  into a single internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both foo.o and bar.o are merged into a single image, this causes all the interprocedural            analyses and optimizations in GCC to work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means, for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in bar.o into  functions  in            foo.o and vice-versa.</p><p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:</p><p>gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c</p><p>The above generates bytecode for foo.c and bar.c, merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes them as usual to produce myprog.</p><p>The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the link step.  GCC automatically performs link-time optimization if any            of the objects involved were compiled with the -flto command-line option.  You can always override the automatic decision to do link-time optimization by passing -fno-lto to the link command.</p><p>To  make  whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries            and runtime outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker, the linker plugin (see -fuse-linker-plugin) passes information to the compiler  about  used  and  externally            visible  symbols.   When  the  linker  plugin  is  not  available,  -fwhole-program  should be used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads to more aggressive optimization            decisions.</p><p>When a file is compiled with -flto without -fuse-linker-plugin, the generated object file is larger than a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and  the  usual  final  code            (see  -ffat-lto-objects).   This  means  that  object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object files; if -fno-lto is passed to the linker, no interprocedural optimizations are            applied.  Note that when -fno-fat-lto-objects is enabled the compile stage is faster but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.</p><p>When producing the final binary, GCC only applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.  Therefore, you can mix  and  match  object  files  and  libraries  with  GIMPLE            bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without further processing.</p><p>Generally,  options  specified at link time override those specified at compile time, although in some cases GCC attempts to infer link-time options from the settings used to compile the input            files.</p><p>If you do not specify an optimization level option -O at link time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level used when compiling the object files.  Note that it is generally ineffective to            specify an optimization level option only at link time and not at compile time, for two reasons.  First, compiling without optimization  suppresses  compiler  passes  that  gather  information            needed for effective optimization at link time.  Second, some early optimization passes can be performed only at compile time and not at link time.</p><p>There  are  some code generation flags preserved by GCC when generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link.  Currently, the following options and their settings are taken            from the first object file that explicitly specifies them: -fcommon, -fexceptions, -fnon-call-exceptions, -fgnu-tm and all the -m target flags.</p><p>The following options -fPIC, -fpic, -fpie and -fPIE are combined based on the following scheme:</p><p>B<-fPIC> + B<-fpic> = B<-fpic>                    B<-fPIC> + B<-fno-pic> = B<-fno-pic>                    B<-fpic/-fPIC> + (no option) = (no option)                    B<-fPIC> + B<-fPIE> = B<-fPIE>                    B<-fpic> + B<-fPIE> = B<-fpie>                    B<-fPIC/-fpic> + B<-fpie> = B<-fpie></p><p>Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units, and trying to override this at link time with a  conflicting  value  is  ignored.   This  includes  options  such  as            <b>`-freg-struct-return and`</b> -fpcc-struct-return.</p><p>` Other  options  such  as  -ffp-contract,  -fno-strict-overflow,  -fwrapv,  -fno-trapv  or  -fno-strict-aliasing  are  passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for conflicting translation units.  Specifically -fno-strict-overflow, -fwrapv and -fno-trapv take precedence; and for example -ffp-contract=off takes precedence over  -ffp-contract=fast.   You  can  override them at link time.</p><p>Diagnostic options such as -Wstringop-overflow are passed through to the link stage and their setting matches that of the compile-step at function granularity.  Note that this matters only for diagnostics  emitted  during  optimization.   Note  that  code transforms such as inlining can lead to warnings being enabled or disabled for regions if code not consistent with the setting at compile time.</p><p>When you need to pass options to the assembler via -Wa or -Xassembler make sure to either compile such translation units with -fno-lto or consistently use the same  assembler  options  on  all translation units.  You can alternatively also specify assembler options at LTO link time.</p><p>To  enable  debug  info  generation you need to supply -g at compile time.  If any of the input files at link time were built with debug info generation enabled the link will enable debug info generation as well.  Any elaborate debug info settings like the dwarf level -gdwarf-5 need to be explicitly repeated at the linker command line  and  mixing  different  settings  in  different translation units is discouraged.</p><p>If  LTO  encounters  objects  with  C  linkage declared with incompatible types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar diagnostics may be raised for other languages.</p><p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural optimizations on files written in different languages:</p><p>gcc -c -flto foo.c         g++ -c -flto bar.cc         gfortran -c -flto baz.f90         g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran</p><p>Notice that the final link is done with g++ to get the C++ runtime libraries and -lgfortran is added to get the Fortran runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO  mode,  you should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a regular (non-LTO) compilation.</p><p>If  object  files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say libfoo.a, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you are using a linker with plugin support. To create static libraries suitable for LTO, use gcc-ar and gcc-ranlib instead of ar and ranlib; to show the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use gcc-nm.  Those  commands  require that ar, ranlib and nm have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the flag -fuse-linker-plugin to ensure that the library participates in the LTO optimization process:</p><p>gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo</p><p>With  the  linker  plugin  enabled,  the  linker  extracts  the  needed  GIMPLE files from libfoo.a and passes them on to the running GCC to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.</p><p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside libfoo.a are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate in the LTO optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable for both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with -flto -ffat-lto-objects.</p><p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to operate.  If the program does not require any  symbols  to  be  exported,  it  is  possible  to  combine  -flto  and -fwhole-program  to  allow  the  interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved optimization opportunities.  Use of -fwhole-program is not needed when linker plugin is active (see -fuse-linker-plugin).</p><p>The current implementation of LTO makes no attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned  and  there  is  a  strict  version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of GCC do not work with an older or newer version of GCC.</p><p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging information on systems other than those using a combination of ELF and DWARF.</p><p>If  you  specify  the  optional n, the optimization and code generation done at link time is executed in parallel using n parallel jobs by utilizing an installed make program.  The environment variable MAKE may be used to override the program used.</p><p>You can also specify -flto=jobserver to use GNU make's job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in  parallel. You  must  prepend  a  +  to  the  command  recipe  in  the  parent  Makefile for this to work.  This option likely only works if MAKE is GNU make.  Even without the option value, GCC tries to automatically detect a running GNU make's job server.</p><p>Use -flto=auto to use GNU make's job server, if available, or otherwise fall back to autodetection of the number of CPU threads present in your system. `</p><p><b>`-flto-partition`</b>=alg            Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.  The value is either 1to1 to specify a partitioning mirroring the original source files or balanced to specify  partitioning            into  equally  sized chunks (whenever possible) or max to create new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying none as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely.            The default value is balanced. While 1to1 can be used as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the max partitioning is intended for internal testing only.  The  value  one  specifies            that exactly one partition should be used while the value none bypasses partitioning and executes the link-time optimization step directly from the WPA phase.</p><p><b>`-flto-compression-level`</b>=n            This  option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate language written to LTO object files, and is only meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode (-flto).  GCC currently supports            two LTO compression algorithms. For zstd, valid values are 0 (no compression) to 19 (maximum compression), while zlib supports values from 0 to 9.  Values outside this  range  are  clamped  to            either minimum or maximum of the supported values.  If the option is not given, a default balanced compression setting is used.</p><p><b>`-fuse-linker-plugin`</b>            Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.</p><p>This  option  enables  the  extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing more code to the link-time optimizer.            This information specifies what symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and  shared  libraries  that            use hidden visibility) are similar to -fwhole-program.  See -flto for a description of the effect of this flag and how to use it.</p><p>This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was configured for use with a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).</p><p><b>`-ffat-lto-objects`</b>            Fat  LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language and the object code. This makes them usable for both LTO linking and normal linking. This option is effective only            when compiling with -flto and is ignored at link time.</p><p><b>`-fno-fat-lto-objects improves`</b> compilation time over plain LTO, but requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with linker plugin support for basic  functionality. ` Additionally,  nm,  ar  and  ranlib need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment (capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the gcc-ar, gcc-nm, gcc- ranlib wrappers to pass the right options to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles need to be modified to use them.</p><p>Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism.  Installing the linker plugin into $libdir/bfd-plugins has the same effect as usage of the command wrappers  (gcc-ar,  gcc-nm  and gcc-ranlib).</p><p>The default is -fno-fat-lto-objects on targets with linker plugin support. `</p><p><b>`-fcompare-elim`</b>            After  register  allocation  and  post-register  allocation instruction splitting, identify arithmetic instructions that compute processor flags similar to a comparison operation based on that            arithmetic.

The name of the function or the name of the data item determines the            section's name in the output file.</p><p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the ELF object format have  linkers  with            such optimizations.  On AIX, the linker rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact varies.</p><p>Together with a linker garbage collection (linker --gc-sections option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after stripping).</p><p>On ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.</p><p>Only  use  these  options  when  there  are significant benefits from doing so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and executable files and are also            slower.  These options affect code generation.  They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative locations inside a translation unit  since  the  locations  are  unknown            until link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call instructions.</p><p><b>`-fstdarg-opt`</b>            Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions with respect to usage of those arguments.</p><p><b>`-fsection-anchors`</b>            Try  to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using shared "anchor" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT            accesses on some targets.</p><p>For example, the implementation of the following function "foo":</p><p>static int a, b, c;                    int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }</p><p>usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you compile it with -fsection-anchors, it accesses the variables from a common anchor point instead.

You can control some of these constants on the command line using the --param option.</p><p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change without notice in future releases.</p><p>In order to get the minimal, maximal and default values of a parameter, use the --help=param -Q options.</p><p>In each case, the value is an integer.  The following choices of name are recognized for all targets:</p><p>predictable-branch-outcome                When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold (in percent), then it is considered well predictable.</p><p>max-rtl-if-conversion-insns                RTL if-conversion tries to remove conditional branches around a block and replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  This parameter gives the maximum number of instructions in                a block which should be considered for if-conversion.  The compiler will also use other heuristics to decide whether if-conversion is likely to be profitable.</p><p>max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost                RTL if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches around a block and replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  These parameters give the maximum permissible cost  for                the sequence that would be generated by if-conversion depending on whether the branch is statically determined to be predictable or not.  The units for this parameter are the same as those                for the GCC internal seq_cost metric.  The compiler will try to provide a reasonable default for this parameter using the BRANCH_COST target macro.</p><p>max-crossjump-edges                The  maximum  number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.  The algorithm used by -fcrossjumping is O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean                more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably small improvement in executable size.</p><p>min-crossjump-insns                The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the                block being cross-jumped from are matched.</p><p>max-grow-copy-bb-insns                The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.</p><p>max-goto-duplication-insns                The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a  number  of  passes,  GCC  factors  computed  gotos  early  in  the                compilation process, and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are unfactored.</p><p>max-delay-slot-insn-search                The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of instructions are searched, the time savings from                filling  the  delay  slot  are  minimal,  so  stop  searching.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably small improvement in                execution time.</p><p>max-delay-slot-live-search                When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to consider when searching for a block with valid live register information.  Increasing this arbitrarily  chosen  value                means more aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the control-flow graph.</p><p>max-gcse-memory                The  approximate  maximum  amount  of  memory  in "kB" that can be allocated in order to perform the global common subexpression elimination optimization.  If more memory than specified is                required, the optimization is not done.</p><p>max-gcse-insertion-ratio                If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value for any expression, then RTL PRE inserts  or  removes  the  expression  and  thus  leaves  partially  redundant                computations in the instruction stream.</p><p>max-pending-list-length                The  maximum  number of pending dependencies scheduling allows before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions with few branches or calls can create excessively large                lists which needlessly consume memory and resources.</p><p>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts                The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase compilation time.</p><p>max-inline-functions-called-once-loop-depth                Maximal loop depth of a call considered by inline heuristics that tries to inline all functions called once.</p><p>max-inline-functions-called-once-insns                Maximal estimated size of functions produced while inlining functions called once.</p><p>max-inline-insns-single                Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC.  This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's internal representation) in a single function that the  tree                inliner considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++).</p><p>max-inline-insns-auto                When you use -finline-functions (included in -O3), a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different                (more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can be applied (--param max-inline-insns-auto).</p><p>max-inline-insns-small                This is bound applied to calls which are considered relevant with -finline-small-functions.</p><p>max-inline-insns-size                This is bound applied to calls which are optimized for size. Small growth may be desirable to anticipate optimization oppurtunities exposed by inlining.</p><p>uninlined-function-insns                Number of instructions accounted by inliner for function overhead such as function prologue and epilogue.</p><p>uninlined-function-time                Extra time accounted by inliner for function overhead such as time needed to execute function prologue and epilogue.</p><p>inline-heuristics-hint-percent                The  scale  (in  percents)  applied  to  inline-insns-single,  inline-insns-single-O2,  inline-insns-auto  when  inline heuristics hints that inlining is very profitable (will enable later                optimizations).</p><p>uninlined-thunk-insns            uninlined-thunk-time                Same as --param uninlined-function-insns and --param uninlined-function-time but applied to function thunks.</p><p>inline-min-speedup                When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this threshold (in percent), the function can be inlined regardless of  the  limit  on  --param  max-inline-insns-                single and --param max-inline-insns-auto.</p><p>large-function-insns                The  limit  specifying  really  large  functions.   For functions larger than this limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by --param large-function-growth.  This parameter is useful                primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the back end.</p><p>large-function-growth                Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.  For example, parameter value 100 limits large function growth to 2.0 times the original size.</p><p>large-unit-insns                The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of units larger than this limit is limited by --param inline-unit-growth.  For small units this might be too  tight.                For example, consider a unit consisting of function A that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is                very  sane.   For very large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for smaller                units, the size is increased to --param large-unit-insns before applying --param inline-unit-growth.</p><p>lazy-modules                Maximum number of concurrently open C++ module files when lazy loading.</p><p>inline-unit-growth                Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.  For example, parameter value 20 limits unit growth to 1.2 times the  original  size.  Cold  functions  (either                marked cold via an attribute or by profile feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.</p><p>ipa-cp-unit-growth                Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by interprocedural constant propagation.  For example, parameter value 10 limits unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.</p><p>ipa-cp-large-unit-insns                The size of translation unit that IPA-CP pass considers large.</p><p>large-stack-frame                The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying to not grow past this limit too much.</p><p>large-stack-frame-growth                Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.  For example, parameter value 1000 limits large stack frame growth to 11 times the original size.</p><p>max-inline-insns-recursive            max-inline-insns-recursive-auto                Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a self-recursive inline function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.</p><p><b>`--param  max-inline-insns-recursive`</b>  applies  to functions declared inline.

In effect it increases the amount of inlining for code having a large abstraction penalty.</p><p>max-early-inliner-iterations     Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically bounds the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner can resolve.  Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.</p><p>comdat-sharing-probability     Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with comdat visibility are shared across multiple compilation units.</p><p>modref-max-bases modref-max-refs modref-max-accesses     Specifies the maximal number of base pointers, references and accesses stored for a single function by mod/ref analysis.</p><p>modref-max-tests     Specifies the maxmal number of tests alias oracle can perform to disambiguate memory locations using the mod/ref information.

If the value is 0, the compiler uses an id that is based on function assembler name and filename,     which makes old profile data more tolerant to source changes such as function reordering etc.</p><p>min-vect-loop-bound     The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized when -ftree-vectorize is used.

This is currently supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the     more aggressive code hoisting is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost less than gcse-unrestricted-cost.  Specifying 0 disables hoisting of simple expressions.</p><p>gcse-unrestricted-cost     Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not constrain the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently supported     only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost, the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0 allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.</p><p>max-hoist-depth     The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.

The     default  is 10000, which means that a basic block is considered hot if its execution count is greater than 1/10000 of the maximal execution count.  0 means that it is never considered hot.     Used in non-LTO mode.</p><p>hot-bb-count-ws-permille     The number of most executed permilles, ranging from 0 to 1000, of the profiled execution of the entire program to which the execution count of a basic block must be part of in order to  be     considered  hot.  The default is 990, which means that a basic block is considered hot if its execution count contributes to the upper 990 permilles, or 99.0%, of the profiled execution of     the entire program.  0 means that it is never considered hot.  Used in LTO mode.</p><p>hot-bb-frequency-fraction     The denominator n of fraction 1/n of the execution frequency of the entry block of a function that a basic block of this function needs to at least have in order to be considered hot.  The     default is 1000, which means that a basic block is considered hot in a function if it is executed more frequently than 1/1000 of the frequency of the entry block of the function.  0  means     that it is never considered hot.</p><p>unlikely-bb-count-fraction     The  denominator  n  of  fraction  1/n  of  the  number  of  profiled runs of the entire program below which the execution count of a basic block must be in order for the basic block to be     considered unlikely executed.

This is useful in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and another loop  with  unknown  bound.   The     known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the loop without bounds appears artificially cold relative     to the other one.</p><p>builtin-expect-probability     Control the probability of the expression having the specified value.

This is a rather artificial limit, as most of the duplicates are eliminated later in cross jumping, so it may be set     to much higher values than is the desired code growth.</p><p>tracer-min-branch-ratio     Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this threshold (in percent).</p><p>tracer-min-branch-probability tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback     Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this threshold.</p><p>Similarly to tracer-dynamic-coverage two parameters are provided.  tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback is used for compilation with profile  feedback  and  tracer-min-branch-probability     compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to make tracer effective.</p><p>stack-clash-protection-guard-size     Specify  the  size  of  the  operating  system provided stack guard as 2 raised to num bytes.  Higher values may reduce the number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating     system provided guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.</p><p>stack-clash-protection-probe-interval     Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it is allocated.  This param controls the maximum distance between probes into the stack as 2 raised to num bytes.  Higher values may     reduce the number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating system provided guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.</p><p>max-cse-path-length     The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE considers.</p><p>max-cse-insns     The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before flushing.</p><p>ggc-min-expand     GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage collector's heap should be allowed to expand between     collections.  Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.</p><p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when RAM >= 1GB.

If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and ggc-min-heapsize to zero causes a full collection to     occur at every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for debugging.</p><p>ggc-min-heapsize     Minimum  size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands by ggc-min-expand% beyond ggc-min-heapsize.     Again, tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code generation.</p><p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but with a lower bound of  4096  (four  megabytes)  and  an     upper  bound  of  131072  (128  megabytes).   If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter very large effectively disables     garbage collection.  Setting this parameter and ggc-min-expand to zero causes a full collection to occur at every opportunity.</p><p>max-reload-search-insns     The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization,  making  the  compilation  time  increase  with     probably slightly better performance.</p><p>max-cselib-memory-locations     The  maximum  number  of memory locations cselib should take into account.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably slightly     better performance.</p><p>max-sched-ready-insns     The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing  values  mean  more  thorough  searches,     making the compilation time increase with probably little benefit.</p><p>max-sched-region-blocks     The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for interblock scheduling.</p><p>max-pipeline-region-blocks     The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for pipelining in the selective scheduler.</p><p>max-sched-region-insns     The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for interblock scheduling.</p><p>max-pipeline-region-insns     The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for pipelining in the selective scheduler.</p><p>min-spec-prob     The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source block for interblock speculative scheduling.</p><p>max-sched-extend-regions-iters     The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend regions.

It is a depth of search for available instructions.</p><p>selsched-max-sched-times     The maximum number of times that an instruction is scheduled during selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number of iterations through which the instruction may be pipelined.</p><p>selsched-insns-to-rename     The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that are considered for renaming in the selective scheduler.</p><p>sms-min-sc     The minimum value of stage count that swing modulo scheduler generates.</p><p>max-last-value-rtl     The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.</p><p>max-combine-insns     The maximum number of instructions the RTL combiner tries to combine.</p><p>integer-share-limit     Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum value of a shared integer constant.</p><p>ssp-buffer-size     The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive stack smashing protection when -fstack-protector is used.</p><p>This default before Ubuntu 10.10 was "8". Currently it is "4", to increase the number of functions protected by the stack protector.</p><p>min-size-for-stack-sharing     The minimum size of variables taking part in stack slot sharing when not optimizing.</p><p>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts     Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be duplicated when threading jumps.</p><p>max-jump-thread-paths     The maximum number of paths to consider when searching for jump threading opportunities.  When arriving at a block, incoming edges are only considered if the number of paths to be searched     so far multiplied by the number of incoming edges does not exhaust the specified maximum number of paths to consider.</p><p>max-fields-for-field-sensitive     Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.</p><p>prefetch-latency     Estimate  on  average  number  of instructions that are executed before prefetch finishes.  The distance prefetched ahead is proportional to this constant.  Increasing this number may also     lead to less streams being prefetched (see simultaneous-prefetches).</p><p>simultaneous-prefetches     Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.</p><p>l1-cache-line-size     The size of cache line in L1 data cache, in bytes.</p><p>l1-cache-size     The size of L1 data cache, in kilobytes.</p><p>l2-cache-size     The size of L2 data cache, in kilobytes.</p><p>prefetch-dynamic-strides     Whether the loop array prefetch pass should issue software prefetch hints for strides that are non-constant.  In some cases this may be beneficial, though  the  fact  the  stride  is  non-     constant may make it hard to predict when there is clear benefit to issuing these hints.</p><p>Set  to  1  if the prefetch hints should be issued for non-constant strides.  Set to 0 if prefetch hints should be issued only for strides that are known to be constant and below prefetch-     minimum-stride.</p><p>prefetch-minimum-stride     Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to start using prefetch hints for.  If the stride is less than this threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued.</p><p>This setting is useful for processors that have hardware prefetchers, in which case there may be conflicts between the hardware prefetchers and the software prefetchers.  If  the  hardware     prefetchers have a maximum stride they can handle, it should be used here to improve the use of software prefetchers.</p><p>A value of -1 means we don't have a threshold and therefore prefetch hints can be issued for any constant stride.</p><p>This setting is only useful for strides that are known and constant.</p><p>destructive-interference-size constructive-interference-size     The  values  for  the  C++17  variables  "std::hardware_destructive_interference_size" and "std::hardware_constructive_interference_size".  The destructive interference size is the minimum     recommended offset between two independent concurrently-accessed objects; the constructive interference size is the  maximum  recommended  size  of  contiguous  memory  accessed  together.     Typically  both  will  be the size of an L1 cache line for the target, in bytes.  For a generic target covering a range of L1 cache line sizes, typically the constructive interference size     will be the small end of the range and the destructive size will be the large end.</p><p>The destructive interference size is intended to be used for layout, and thus has ABI impact.  The default value is not expected to be stable, and on some targets varies  with  -mtune,  so     use  of  this variable in a context where ABI stability is important, such as the public interface of a library, is strongly discouraged; if it is used in that context, users can stabilize     the value using this option.</p><p>The constructive interference size is less sensitive, as it is typically only used in a static_assert to make sure that a type fits within a cache line.</p><p>See also -Winterference-size.</p><p>loop-interchange-max-num-stmts     The maximum number of stmts in a loop to be interchanged.</p><p>loop-interchange-stride-ratio     The minimum ratio between stride of two loops for interchange to be profitable.</p><p>min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio     The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.</p><p>prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio     The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.</p><p>use-canonical-types     Whether the compiler should use the "canonical" type system.  Should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However,  if     bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures, set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.</p><p>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio     Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are bigger than switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio times the number of branches in the switch.</p><p>max-partial-antic-length     Maximum  length  of the partial antic set computed during the tree partial redundancy elimination optimization (-ftree-pre) when optimizing at -O3 and above.  For some sorts of source code     the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away, consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This parameter sets a limit on the  length  of  the  sets     that are computed, which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for this parameter allows an unlimited set length.</p><p>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth     Maximum  loop  depth  that  is  value-numbered  optimistically.   When  the  limit hits the innermost rpo-vn-max-loop-depth loops and the outermost loop in the loop nest are value-numbered     optimistically and the remaining ones not.</p><p>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access     Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search is aborted and the load or store  is  not  considered     redundant.  The number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of stores on all paths from the load to the function entry.</p><p>ira-max-loops-num     IRA  uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most the given number of the most frequently-executed     loops form regions for regional register allocation.</p><p>ira-max-conflict-table-size     Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for  huge  functions.   If  the  conflict  table  for  a     function  could  be  more  than  the size in MB given by this parameter, the register allocator instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality algorithm that does not require building a     pseudo-register conflict table.</p><p>ira-loop-reserved-regs     IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops for decisions to move loop invariants (see -O3).  The number of available registers reserved for some other purposes is     given by this parameter.  Default of the parameter is the best found from numerous experiments.</p><p>ira-consider-dup-in-all-alts     Make IRA to consider matching constraint (duplicated operand number) heavily in all available alternatives for preferred register class.  If it is set as zero, it means IRA  only  respects     the  matching  constraint  when  it's  in  the  only  available alternative with an appropriate register class.  Otherwise, it means IRA will check all available alternatives for preferred     register class even if it has found some choice with an appropriate register class and respect the found qualified matching constraint.</p><p>ira-simple-lra-insn-threshold     Approximate function insn number in 1K units triggering simple local RA.</p><p>lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff     LRA tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in subsequent insns.  This optimization is called inheritance.  EBB is used as a region to do this optimization.  The  parameter  defines  a     minimal fall-through edge probability in percentage used to add BB to inheritance EBB in LRA.  The default value was chosen from numerous runs of SPEC2000 on x86-64.</p><p>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop     Loop  invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops with more basic blocks than this parameter     won't have loop invariant motion optimization performed on them.</p><p>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps     Building data dependencies is expensive for very large loops.  This parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are considered for data dependence analysis.   These  large     loops are no handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.</p><p>max-vartrack-size     Sets  a  maximum  number  of  hash  table slots to use during variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded with variable tracking at assignments enabled,     analysis for that function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var tracking analysis is  completely     disabled for the function.  Setting the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.</p><p>max-vartrack-expr-depth     Sets  a  maximum  number  of  recursion  levels  when  attempting  to  map  variable  names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades compilation time for more complete debug     information.  If this is set too low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in debug information may end up not being used;  setting  this  higher  may  enable  the     compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile time and memory use may grow.</p><p>max-debug-marker-count     Sets  a threshold on the number of debug markers (e.g. begin stmt markers) to avoid complexity explosion at inlining or expanding to RTL.  If a function has more such gimple stmts than the     set limit, such stmts will be dropped from the inlined copy of a function, and from its RTL expansion.</p><p>min-nondebug-insn-uid     Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by -fvar-tracking-assignments, but  debug  insns  may     get (non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.</p><p>ipa-sra-deref-prob-threshold     IPA-SRA  replaces a pointer which is known not be NULL with one or more new parameters only when the probability (in percent, relative to function entry) of it being dereferenced is higher     than this parameter.</p><p>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor     IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new parameters only when their cumulative size is less or equal to ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor times  the  size  of  the  original     pointer parameter.</p><p>ipa-sra-ptrwrap-growth-factor     Additional  maximum allowed growth of total size of new parameters that ipa-sra replaces a pointer to an aggregate with, if it points to a local variable that the caller only writes to and     passes it as an argument to other functions.</p><p>ipa-sra-max-replacements     Maximum pieces of an aggregate that IPA-SRA tracks.  As a consequence, it is also the maximum number of replacements of a formal parameter.</p><p>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize     The two Scalar Reduction of Aggregates passes (SRA and IPA-SRA) aim to replace scalar parts of aggregates with uses of independent scalar variables.  These parameters control  the  maximum     size,  in  storage  units,  of  aggregate  which  is  considered  for  replacement  when  compiling for speed (sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed) or size (sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize)     respectively.</p><p>sra-max-propagations     The maximum number of artificial accesses that Scalar Replacement of Aggregates (SRA) will track, per one local variable, in order to facilitate copy propagation.</p><p>tm-max-aggregate-size     When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this parameter specifies the size in bytes after which  variables  are  saved  with  the  logging  functions  as  opposed  to     save/restore code sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using -fgnu-tm.</p><p>graphite-max-nb-scop-params     To  avoid  exponential  effects  in  the  Graphite  loop transforms, the number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  A value of zero can be used to lift the bound.  A     variable whose value is unknown at compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.</p><p>loop-block-tile-size     Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with -floop-block or -floop-strip-mine, strip mine each loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip  length  can  be     changed using the loop-block-tile-size parameter.</p><p>ipa-jump-function-lookups     Specifies number of statements visited during jump function offset discovery.</p><p>ipa-cp-value-list-size     IPA-CP  attempts  to  track  all  possible values and types passed to a function's parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization.  ipa-cp-value-list-size is the maximum     number of values and types it stores per one formal parameter of a function.</p><p>ipa-cp-eval-threshold     IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability heuristics and performs those cloning opportunities with scores that exceed ipa-cp-eval-threshold.</p><p>ipa-cp-max-recursive-depth     Maximum depth of recursive cloning for self-recursive function.</p><p>ipa-cp-min-recursive-probability     Recursive cloning only when the probability of call being executed exceeds the parameter.</p><p>ipa-cp-profile-count-base     When using -fprofile-use option, IPA-CP will consider the measured execution count of a call graph edge at this percentage position in their histogram  as  the  basis  for  its  heuristics     calculation.</p><p>ipa-cp-recursive-freq-factor     The number of times interprocedural copy propagation expects recursive functions to call themselves.</p><p>ipa-cp-recursion-penalty     Percentage penalty the recursive functions will receive when they are evaluated for cloning.</p><p>ipa-cp-single-call-penalty     Percentage penalty functions containing a single call to another function will receive when they are evaluated for cloning.</p><p>ipa-max-agg-items     IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values passed in an aggregate. ipa-max-agg-items controls the maximum number of such values per one parameter.</p><p>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus     When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the number of iterations of a loop known, it adds a bonus of ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus to the profitability score of the candidate.</p><p>ipa-max-loop-predicates     The maximum number of different predicates IPA will use to describe when loops in a function have known properties.</p><p>ipa-max-aa-steps     During  its  analysis  of  function  bodies,  IPA-CP  employs  alias  analysis  in order to track values pointed to by function parameters.  In order not spend too much time analyzing huge     functions, it gives up and consider all memory clobbered after examining ipa-max-aa-steps statements modifying memory.</p><p>ipa-max-switch-predicate-bounds     Maximal number of boundary endpoints of case ranges of switch statement.  For switch exceeding this limit, IPA-CP will not construct cloning cost  predicate,  which  is  used  to  estimate     cloning benefit, for default case of the switch statement.</p><p>ipa-max-param-expr-ops     IPA-CP  will  analyze conditional statement that references some function parameter to estimate benefit for cloning upon certain constant value.  But if number of operations in a parameter     expression exceeds ipa-max-param-expr-ops, the expression is treated as complicated one, and is not handled by IPA analysis.</p><p>lto-partitions     Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR compilation.  The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation.</p><p>lto-min-partition     Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions).

Larger  numbers  result  in     more aggressive statement sinking.  A small positive adjustment is applied for statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.</p><p>max-stores-to-sink     The maximum number of conditional store pairs that can be sunk.  Set to 0 if either vectorization (-ftree-vectorize) or if-conversion (-ftree-loop-if-convert) is disabled.</p><p>case-values-threshold     The smallest number of different values for which it is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.

Algorithm 1 is the original implementation and is the more likely to prevent instructions from being reordered.     Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise between the relatively conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive approach taken by the default scheduler.  It  relies     more heavily on having a regular register file and accurate register pressure classes.

For example, one purpose  of  instrumentation  is  collect  profiling statistics  for  use  in  finding  program  hot  spots,  code  coverage  analysis,  or profile-guided optimizations.  Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking to detect programming errors like invalid pointer dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++  vtable  hijacking.   There  is  also  a general hook which can be used to implement other forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or program analysis purposes. </code></p><p><b>`-p`</b>        <b>`-pg Generate`</b>  extra  code  to  write profile information suitable for the analysis program prof (for -p) or gprof (for -pg).  You must use this option when compiling the source files you want data            about, and you must also use it when linking.</p><p>You can use the function attribute "no_instrument_function" to suppress profiling of individual functions when compiling with these options.</p><p><b>`-fprofile-arcs`</b>            Add code so that program flow arcs are instrumented.  During execution the program records how many times each branch and call is executed and how many  times  it  is  taken  or  returns.   On            targets  that  support  constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors, destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used as a type of a            global variable.</p><p>When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called auxname.gcda for each source file.  The data may be used for profile-directed optimizations (-fbranch-probabilities), or for            test coverage analysis (-ftest-coverage).  Each object file's auxname is generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is            the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. foo.gcda for input file dir/foo.c, or dir/foo.gcda for output file specified as -o dir/foo.o).</p><p>Note that if a command line directly links source files, the corresponding .gcda files will be prefixed with the unsuffixed name of the output  file.   E.g.  "gcc  a.c  b.c  -o  binary"  would            generate binary-a.gcda and binary-b.gcda files.</p><p><b>`--coverage`</b>            This  option  is  used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage analysis.  The option is a synonym for -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage (when compiling) and -lgcov (when linking).  See            the documentation for those options for more details.</p><p>*   Compile the source files with -fprofile-arcs plus optimization and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the additional -ftest-coverage option.   You  do  not  need  to                profile every source file in a program.</p><p>*   Compile the source files additionally with -fprofile-abs-path to create absolute path names in the .gcno files.  This allows gcov to find the correct sources in projects where compilations                occur with different working directories.</p><p>*   Link your object files with -lgcov or -fprofile-arcs (the latter implies the former).</p><p>*   Run  the  program  on  a  representative workload to generate the arc profile information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run concurrent instances of your program, and                provided that the file system supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Unless a strict ISO C dialect option is in  effect,  "fork"  calls  are  detected  and  correctly                handled without double counting.</p><p>Moreover, an object file can be recompiled multiple times and the corresponding .gcda file merges as long as the source file and the compiler options are unchanged.</p><p>*   For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with the same optimization and code generation options plus -fbranch-probabilities.</p><p>*   For test coverage analysis, use gcov to produce human readable information from the .gcno and .gcda files.  Refer to the gcov documentation for further information.</p><p>With  -fprofile-arcs,  for  each  function  of  your program GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be            instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added            to the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.</p><p><b>`-ftest-coverage`</b>            Produce a notes file that the gcov code-coverage utility can use to show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called auxname.gcno.  Refer to the -fprofile-arcs option above for a            description of auxname and instructions on how to generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the source files more closely if you do not optimize.</p><p><b>`-fprofile-abs-path`</b>            Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names in the .gcno files.  This allows gcov to find the correct sources in projects where compilations  occur  with  different            working directories.</p><p><b>`-fprofile-dir`</b>=path            Set  the  directory  to  search  for  the profile data files in to path.  This option affects only the profile data generated by -fprofile-generate, -ftest-coverage, -fprofile-arcs and used by            <b>`-fprofile-use and`</b> -fbranch-probabilities and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.  By default, GCC uses the current directory as path, thus the profile data file ` appears in the same directory as the object file.  In order to prevent the file name clashing, if the object  file  name  is  not  an  absolute  path,  we  mangle  the  absolute  path  of  the sourcename.gcda file and use it as the file name of a .gcda file.  See details about the file naming in -fprofile-arcs.  See similar option -fprofile-note.</p><p>When an executable is run in a massive parallel environment, it is recommended to save profile to different folders.

You must use -fprofile-generate both when            compiling and when linking your program.</p><p>The following options are enabled: -fprofile-arcs, -fprofile-values, -finline-functions, and -fipa-bit-cp.</p><p>If path is specified, GCC looks at the path to find the profile feedback data files. See -fprofile-dir.</p><p>To optimize the program based on the collected profile information, use -fprofile-use.</p><p><b>`-fprofile-info-section`</b>        <b>`-fprofile-info-section`</b>=name            Register  the  profile  information  in  the  specified  section instead of using a constructor/destructor.  The section name is name if it is specified, otherwise the section name defaults to            ".gcov_info".  A pointer to the profile information generated by -fprofile-arcs is placed in the specified section for each translation unit.  This  option  disables  the  profile  information            registration  through  a  constructor and it disables the profile information processing through a destructor.  This option is not intended to be used in hosted environments such as GNU/Linux.

For most targets, the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.</p><p>For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address 0x80000000 and grows downwards, you can use the  flags  -fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit  and  -Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000  to            enforce a stack limit of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.</p><p>You can locally override stack limit checking by using the "no_stack_limit" function attribute.</p><p><b>`-fsplit-stack`</b>            Generate  code  to  automatically  split  the  stack before it overflows.  The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more            memory.  This is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This is currently only implemented for the x86            targets running GNU/Linux.</p><p>When code compiled with -fsplit-stack calls code compiled without -fsplit-stack, there may not be much stack space available for the latter code to  run.   If  compiling  all  code,  including            library  code,  with  -fsplit-stack  is  not  an  option,  then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled without -fsplit-stack always has a large stack.  Support for this is            implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21 and later.</p><p><b>`-fvtable-verify`</b>=[std|preinit|none]            This option is only available when compiling C++ code.  It turns on (or off, if using -fvtable-verify=none) the security feature that verifies at run time, for every  virtual  call,  that  the            vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable pointer is detected at run time, an error is            reported and execution of the program is immediately halted.</p><p>This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup, which are used for verifying the vtable pointers.  The options std and preinit control the timing of when these data            structures  are  built.   In  both cases the data structures are built before execution reaches "main".  Using -fvtable-verify=std causes the data structures to be built after shared libraries            have been loaded and initialized.  -fvtable-verify=preinit causes them to be built before shared libraries have been loaded and initialized.</p><p>If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different values specified, none takes highest priority over both std and preinit; preinit takes priority over std.</p><p><b>`-fvtv-debug`</b>            When used in conjunction with -fvtable-verify=std or -fvtable-verify=preinit, causes debug versions of the runtime functions for the vtable verification feature to be called.  This  flag  also            causes  the  compiler  to  log  information about which vtable pointers it finds for each class.  This information is written to a file named vtv_set_ptr_data.log in the directory named by the            environment variable VTV_LOGS_DIR if that is defined or the current working directory otherwise.</p><p>Note:  This feature appends data to the log file. If you want a fresh log file, be sure to delete any existing one.</p><p><b>`-fvtv-counts`</b>            This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with -fvtable-verify=std or -fvtable-verify=preinit, this causes the compiler to keep  track  of  the  total  number  of  virtual  calls  it            encounters  and the number of verifications it inserts.  It also counts the number of calls to certain run-time library functions that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation            unit.  The compiler writes this information to a file named vtv_count_data.log in the directory named by the environment variable VTV_LOGS_DIR  if  that  is  defined  or  the  current  working            directory otherwise.  It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets for each class, and writes this information to vtv_class_set_sizes.log in the same directory.</p><p>Note:  This feature appends data to the log files.  To get fresh log files, be sure to delete any existing ones.</p><p><b>`-finstrument-functions`</b>            Generate  instrumentation  calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just after function entry and just before function exit, the following profiling functions are called with the address of the            current function and its call site.  (On some platforms, "__builtin_return_address" does not work beyond the current function, so the  call  site  information  may  not  be  available  to  the            profiling functions otherwise.)</p><p>void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,                                                   void *call_site);                    void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,                                                   void *call_site);</p><p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.</p><p>This  instrumentation  is  also done for functions expanded inline in other functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the inline function is entered and exited.  This means            that addressable versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of code  size.   If  you  use  "extern            inline"  in  your  C  code,  an  addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the functions            inline, you might have gotten away without providing static copies.)</p><p>A function may be given the attribute "no_instrument_function", in which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for example, for the profiling functions listed above,  high-            priority  interrupt  routines,  and  any  functions  from  which the profiling functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling routines generate output or allocate            memory).</p><p><b>`-finstrument-functions-once`</b>            This is similar to -finstrument-functions, but the profiling functions are called only once per instrumented function, i.e. the first profiling function is called after the  first  entry  into            the instrumented function and the second profiling function is called before the exit corresponding to this first entry.</p><p>The  definition of "once" for the purpose of this option is a little vague because the implementation is not protected against data races.  As a result, the implementation only guarantees that            the profiling functions are called at least once per process and at most once per thread, but the calls are always paired, that is to say, if a thread calls the first function,  then  it  will            call the second function, unless it never reaches the exit of the instrumented function.</p><p><b>`-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list`</b>=file,file,...            Set  the  list  of  functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see the description of -finstrument-functions).  If the file that contains a function definition matches with one of file,            then that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings: if the file parameter is a substring of the file name, it is considered to be a match.</p><p>For example:</p><p><b>`-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list`</b>=/bits/stl,include/sys</p><p>` excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames contain /bits/stl or include/sys.</p><p>If, for some reason, you want to include letter , in one of sym, write ,.

This is similar to -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list, but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its  user-            visible  name,  such  as "vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)", not the internal mangled name (e.g., "_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE").  The match is done on substrings: if the sym parameter is a            substring of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++ extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not using universal character names.</p><p><b>`-fpatchable-function-entry`</b>=N[,M]            Generate N NOPs right at the beginning of each function, with the function entry point before the Mth NOP.  If M is omitted, it defaults to 0 so the function entry points to the  address  just            at  the  first  NOP.  The NOP instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment is writable.  The amount of            space is controllable indirectly via the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds to the instruction emitted by the internal GCC back-end interface  "gen_nop".   This  behavior  is            target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or other compilation options.</p><p>For   run-time   identification,   the   starting   addresses   of  these  areas,  which  correspond  to  their  respective  function  entries  minus  M,  are  additionally  collected  in  the            "__patchable_function_entries" section of the resulting binary.</p><p>Note that the value of "__attribute__ ((patchable_function_entry (N,M)))" takes precedence over command-line option -fpatchable-function-entry=N,M.  This can be used to increase the area  size            or to remove it completely on a single function.  If "N=0", no pad location is recorded.</p><p>The  NOP  instructions are inserted at---and maybe before, depending on M---the function entry address, even before the prologue.  On PowerPC with the ELFv2 ABI, for a function with dual entry            points, the local entry point is this function entry address.</p><p>The maximum value of N and M is 65535.  On PowerPC with the ELFv2 ABI, for a function with dual entry points, the supported values for M are 0, 2, 6 and 14.</p><p>Options Controlling the Preprocessor ` These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file before actual compilation.</p><p>If you use the -E option, nothing is done except preprocessing.  Some of these options make sense only together with -E because they cause the preprocessor  output  to  be  unsuitable  for  actual compilation.</p><p>In  addition  to  the options listed here, there are a number of options to control search paths for include files documented in Directory Options.  Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in Warning Options. `</p><p><b>`-D name`</b>            Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.</p><p><b>`-D name`</b>=definition            The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a #define directive.  In  particular,  the  definition  is  truncated  by  embedded            newline characters.</p><p>If  you  are  invoking  the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell            syntax.</p><p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if  any).   Parentheses  are  meaningful  to  most            shells, so you should quote the option.  With sh and csh, -D'name(args...)=definition' works.</p><p><b>`-D and`</b> -U options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.  All -imacros file and -include file options are processed after all -D and -U options.</p><p><b>`-U name`</b>            Cancel any previous definition of name, either built in or provided with a -D option.</p><p><b>`-include file`</b>            Process  file  as if "#include "file"" appeared as the first line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched for file is the preprocessor's working directory instead of            the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it is searched for in the remainder of the "#include "..."" search chain as normal.</p><p>If multiple -include options are given, the files are included in the order they appear on the command line.</p><p><b>`-imacros file`</b>            Exactly like -include, except that any output produced by scanning file is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.  This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also            processing its declarations.</p><p>All files specified by -imacros are processed before all files specified by -include.</p><p><b>`-undef`</b>            Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The standard predefined macros remain defined.</p><p><b>`-pthread`</b>            Define additional macros required for using the POSIX threads library.  You should use this option consistently for both compilation  and  linking.   This  option  is  supported  on  GNU/Linux            targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.</p><p><b>`-M  Instead`</b>  of  outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make describing the dependencies of the main source file.  The preprocessor outputs one make rule containing the            object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including those coming from -include or -imacros command-line options.</p><p>Unless specified explicitly (with -MT or -MQ), the object file name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file suffix  and  with  any  leading  directory            parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using \-newline.  The rule has no commands.</p><p>This  option  does  not  suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as -dM.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output            file with -MF, or use an environment variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT.  Debug output is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p><p>Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses warnings with an implicit -w.</p><p><b>`-MM Like`</b> -M but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.</p><p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an #include directive does not in itself determine whether that header appears in -MM dependency output.</p><p><b>`-MF file`</b>            When used with -M or -MM, specifies a file to write the dependencies to.  If no -MF switch is given the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output.</p><p>When used with the driver options -MD or -MMD, -MF overrides the default dependency output file.</p><p>If file is -, then the dependencies are written to stdout.</p><p><b>`-MG In`</b> conjunction with an option such as -M requesting dependency generation, -MG assumes missing header files are generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising  an  error.            The dependency filename is taken directly from the "#include" directive without prepending any path.  -MG also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless.</p><p>This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.</p><p><b>`-Mno-modules`</b>            Disable dependency generation for compiled module interfaces.</p><p><b>`-MP This`</b>  option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors make gives if you remove            header files without updating the Makefile to match.</p><p>This is typical output:</p><p>test.o: test.c test.h</p><p>test.h:</p><p><b>`-MT target`</b>            Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any directory components and any file  suffix  such  as  .c,  and            appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.</p><p>An -MT option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument to -MT, or use multiple -MT options.</p><p>For example, -MT '$(objpfx)foo.o' might give</p><p>$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p><p><b>`-MQ target`</b>            Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters which are special to Make.  -MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o' gives</p><p>$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p><p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with -MQ.</p><p><b>`-MD`</b> -MD  is  equivalent to -M -MF file, except that -E is not implied.  The driver determines file based on whether an -o option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix            of .d, otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a .d suffix.</p><p>If -MD is used in conjunction with -E, any -o switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without -E, each -o is understood to specify a target object file.</p><p>Since -E is not implied, -MD can be used to generate a dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation process.</p><p><b>`-MMD`</b>            Like -MD except mention only user header files, not system header files.</p><p><b>`-fpreprocessed`</b>            Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and  processing  of            most  directives.   The  preprocessor  still  recognizes  and  removes comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with -C to the compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated            preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.</p><p><b>`-fpreprocessed is`</b> implicit if the input file has one of the extensions .i, .ii or .mi.  These are the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by -save-temps.</p><p><b>`-fdirectives-only`</b>            When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.</p><p>The option's behavior depends on the -E and -fpreprocessed options.</p><p>With -E, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives such as "#define", "#ifdef", and "#error".  Other preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph  conversion  are            not performed.  In addition, the -dD option is implicitly enabled.</p><p>With  -fpreprocessed,  predefinition  of  command  line  and  most builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as "__LINE__", which are contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables            compilation of files previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".</p><p>With both -E and -fpreprocessed, the rules for -fpreprocessed take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".</p><p><b>`-fdollars-in-identifiers`</b>            Accept $ in identifiers.</p><p><b>`-fextended-identifiers`</b>            Accept universal character names and extended characters in identifiers.  This option is enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.</p><p><b>`-fno-canonical-system-headers`</b>            When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.</p><p><b>`-fmax-include-depth`</b>=depth            Set the maximum depth of the nested #include. The default is 200.</p><p><b>`-ftabstop`</b>=width            Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1  or  greater            than 100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.</p><p><b>`-ftrack-macro-expansion`</b>[=level]            Track  locations  of  tokens  across macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion.            Using this option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory. The level parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus  decreasing  the            memory  consumption if necessary. Value 0 of level de-activates this option. Value 1 tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens            resulting from the expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the same location. Value 2 tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.  When this option            is given no argument, the default parameter value is 2.</p><p>Note that "-ftrack-macro-expansion=2" is activated by default.</p><p><b>`-fmacro-prefix-map`</b>=old=new            When preprocessing files residing in directory old, expand the "__FILE__" and "__BASE_FILE__" macros as if the files resided in directory new instead.  This can be used to change  an  absolute            path  to  a  relative  path by using . for new which can result in more reproducible builds that are location independent.  This option also affects "__builtin_FILE()" during compilation.  See            also -ffile-prefix-map and -fcanon-prefix-map.</p><p><b>`-fexec-charset`</b>=charset            Set the execution character set, used for string and character constants.  The default is UTF-8.  charset can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.</p><p><b>`-fwide-exec-charset`</b>=charset            Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and character constants.  The default is one of UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE, whichever  corresponds  to  the  width  of            "wchar_t" and the big-endian or little-endian byte order being used for code generation.  As with -fexec-charset, charset can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine;            however, you will have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in "wchar_t".</p><p><b>`-finput-charset`</b>=charset            Set  the  input  character  set,  used for translation from the character set of the input file to the source character set used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this            information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-line option.  Currently the command-line option takes precedence  if  there's  a            conflict.  charset can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.</p><p><b>`-fpch-deps`</b>            When  using  precompiled headers, this flag causes the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified, only the precompiled header            are listed and not the files that were used to create it, because those files are not consulted when a precompiled header is used.</p><p><b>`-fpch-preprocess`</b>            This option allows use of a precompiled header together with -E.  It inserts a special "#pragma", "#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "filename"" in the output to mark the place where the  precompiled            header was found, and its filename.  When -fpreprocessed is in use, GCC recognizes this "#pragma" and loads the PCH.</p><p>This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on by -save-temps.</p><p>You  should  not  write  this  "#pragma"  in your own code, but it is safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a different location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be            relative to GCC's current directory.</p><p><b>`-fworking-directory`</b>            Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that let the compiler know the current working  directory  at  the  time  of  preprocessing.   When  this  option  is  enabled,  the            preprocessor  emits,  after  the  initial  linemarker,  a  second  linemarker  with  the  current  working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC uses this directory, when it's present in the            preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but            this can be inhibited with the negated form -fno-working-directory.  If the -P flag is present in the command line, this  option  has  no  effect,  since  no  "#line"  directives  are  emitted            whatsoever.</p><p><b>`-A predicate`</b>=answer            Make  an  assertion  with  the  predicate  predicate  and answer answer.  This form is preferred to the older form -A predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does not use shell            special characters.</p><p><b>`-A`</b> -predicate=answer            Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.</p><p><b>`-C  Do`</b> not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive.</p><p>You should be prepared for side effects when using -C; it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.  For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be            a directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a #.</p><p><b>`-CC Do`</b> not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is like -C, except that comments contained within macros are also passed  through  to  the  output  file  where  the  macro  is            expanded.</p><p>In  addition  to the side effects of the -C option, the -CC option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use of that macro            from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.</p><p>The -CC option is generally used to support lint comments.</p><p><b>`-P  Inhibit`</b> generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program  which            might be confused by the linemarkers.</p><p><b>`-traditional`</b>        <b>`-traditional-cpp`</b>            Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.

These are three-character sequences, all starting with ??, that are defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  For example, ??/ stands for \, so '??/n' is a            character constant for a newline.</p><p>The nine trigraphs and their replacements are</p><p>Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-                    Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~</p><p>By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the -std and -ansi options.</p><p><b>`-remap`</b>            Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</p><p><b>`-H  Print`</b> the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the #include  stack  it  is.   Precompiled  header  files  are  also            printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with ...x and a valid one with ...! .</p><p><b>`-dletters`</b>            Says  to  make  debugging  dumps  during  compilation as specified by letters.  The flags documented here are those relevant to the preprocessor.  Other letters are interpreted by the compiler            proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently ignored.  If you specify letters whose behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.</p><p><b>`-dM Instead`</b> of the normal output, generate a list of #define directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a  way                of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file foo.h, the command</p><p>touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</p><p>shows all the predefined macros.</p><p>If you use -dM without the -E option, -dM is interpreted as a synonym for -fdump-rtl-mach.</p><p><b>`-dD Like`</b>  -dM  except  in  two  respects: it does not include the predefined macros, and it outputs both the #define directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to the                standard output file.</p><p><b>`-dN Like`</b> -dD, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.</p><p><b>`-dI Output`</b> #include directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.</p><p><b>`-dU Like`</b> -dD except that only macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed until the use or test  of  the  macro;  and                #undef directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time.</p><p><b>`-fdebug-cpp`</b>            This  option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used from CPP or with -E, it dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map            its location belongs to.</p><p>When used from GCC without -E, this option has no effect.</p><p><b>`-Wp`</b>,option            You can use -Wp,option to bypass the compiler driver and pass option directly through to the preprocessor.  If option contains commas,  it  is  split  into  multiple  options  at  the  commas.            However,  many  options are modified, translated or interpreted by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and -Wp forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct            interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you should avoid using -Wp and let the driver handle the options instead.</p><p><b>`-Xpreprocessor option`</b>            Pass option as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC does not recognize.</p><p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use -Xpreprocessor twice, once for the option and once for the argument.</p><p><b>`-no-integrated-cpp`</b>            Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.  By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part of input tokenization and parsing.  If this option is  provided,  the            appropriate  language front end (cc1, cc1plus, or cc1obj for C, C++, and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice, once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation of the            preprocessed input.  This option may be useful in conjunction with the -B or -wrapper options to specify an alternate preprocessor or  perform  additional  processing  of  the  program  source            between normal preprocessing and compilation.</p><p><b>`-flarge-source-files`</b>            Adjust GCC to expect large source files, at the expense of slower compilation and higher memory usage.</p><p>Specifically,  GCC  normally  tracks  both  column  numbers  and line numbers within source files and it normally prints both of these numbers in diagnostics.  However, once it has processed a            certain number of source lines, it stops tracking column numbers and only tracks line numbers.  This means that diagnostics for later lines do not include column numbers.  It also  means  that            options  like  -Wmisleading-indentation  cease  to  work at that point, although the compiler prints a note if this happens.  Passing -flarge-source-files significantly increases the number of            source lines that GCC can process before it stops tracking columns.</p><p>Passing Options to the Assembler <code> You can pass options to the assembler. </code></p><p><b>`-Wa`</b>,option            Pass option as an option to the assembler.  If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.</p><p><b>`-Xassembler option`</b>            Pass option as an option to the assembler.  You can use this to supply system-specific assembler options that GCC does not recognize.</p><p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use -Xassembler twice, once for the option and once for the argument.</p><p>Options for Linking ` These options come into play when the compiler links object files into an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a link step.</p><p>object-file-name     A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are distinguished from libraries by the  linker  according  to  the     file contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input to the linker. `</p><p><b>`-c`</b>        <b>`-S`</b>        <b>`-E  If`</b> any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and object file names should not be used as arguments.</p><p><b>`-flinker-output`</b>=type            This  option controls code generation of the link-time optimizer.  By default the linker output is automatically determined by the linker plugin.  For debugging the compiler and if incremental            linking with a non-LTO object file is desired, it may be useful to control the type manually.</p><p>If type is exec, code generation produces a static binary. In this case -fpic and -fpie are both disabled.</p><p>If type is dyn, code generation produces a shared library.  In this case -fpic or -fPIC is preserved, but not enabled automatically.  This allows to build shared  libraries  without  position-            independent code on architectures where this is possible, i.e. on x86.</p><p>If type is pie, code generation produces an -fpie executable. This results in similar optimizations as exec except that -fpie is not disabled if specified at compilation time.</p><p>If  type  is  rel,  the  compiler  assumes  that incremental linking is done.  The sections containing intermediate code for link-time optimization are merged, pre-optimized, and output to the            resulting object file. In addition, if -ffat-lto-objects is specified, binary code is produced for future non-LTO linking. The object file produced by incremental linking  is  smaller  than  a            static library produced from the same object files.  At link time the result of incremental linking also loads faster than a static library assuming that the majority of objects in the library            are used.</p><p>Finally  nolto-rel  configures  the  compiler for incremental linking where code generation is forced, a final binary is produced, and the intermediate code for later link-time optimization is            stripped. When multiple object files are linked together the resulting code is better optimized than with link-time optimizations disabled (for example,  cross-module  inlining  happens),  but            most of benefits of whole program optimizations are lost.</p><p>During  the incremental link (by -r) the linker plugin defaults to rel. With current interfaces to GNU Binutils it is however not possible to incrementally link LTO objects and non-LTO objects            into a single mixed object file.  If any of object files in incremental link cannot be used for link-time optimization, the linker plugin issues a warning and uses nolto-rel. To maintain whole            program optimization, it is recommended to link such objects into static library instead. Alternatively it is possible to use H.J. Lu's binutils with support for mixed objects.</p><p><b>`-fuse-ld`</b>=bfd            Use the bfd linker instead of the default linker.</p><p><b>`-fuse-ld`</b>=gold            Use the gold linker instead of the default linker.</p><p><b>`-fuse-ld`</b>=lld            Use the LLVM lld linker instead of the default linker.</p><p><b>`-fuse-ld`</b>=mold            Use the Modern Linker (mold) instead of the default linker.</p><p><b>`-llibrary`</b>        <b>`-l library`</b>            Search the library named library when linking.  (The second alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)</p><p>The -l option is passed directly to the linker by GCC.  Refer to your linker documentation for exact details.  The general description below applies to the GNU linker.</p><p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library.  The directories searched include several standard system directories plus any that you specify with -L.</p><p>Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file names like liblibrary.a.  Some targets also support shared libraries, which typically  have  names  like  liblibrary.so.   If  both            static and shared libraries are found, the linker gives preference to linking with the shared library unless the -static option is used.</p><p>It  makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they are specified.  Thus, foo.o -lz bar.o searches            library z after file foo.o but before bar.o.  If bar.o refers to functions in z, those functions may not be loaded.</p><p><b>`-lobjc`</b>            You need this special case of the -l option in order to link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.</p><p><b>`-nostartfiles`</b>            Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The standard system libraries are used normally, unless -nostdlib, -nolibc, or -nodefaultlibs is used.</p><p><b>`-nodefaultlibs`</b>            Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as  -static-libgcc            or -shared-libgcc, are ignored.  The standard startup files are used normally, unless -nostartfiles is used.</p><p>The compiler may generate calls to "memcmp", "memset", "memcpy" and "memmove".  These entries are usually resolved by entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other            mechanism when this option is specified.</p><p><b>`-nolibc`</b>            Do  not use the C library or system libraries tightly coupled with it when linking.  Still link with the startup files, libgcc or toolchain provided language support libraries such as libgnat,            libgfortran or libstdc++ unless options preventing their inclusion are used as well.  This typically removes -lc from the link command line, as well as system libraries that normally  go  with            it  and  become  meaningless  when  absence  of  a C library is assumed, for example -lpthread or -lm in some configurations.  This is intended for bare-board targets when there is indeed no C            library available.</p><p><b>`-nostdlib`</b>            Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.  No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options  specifying  linkage  of  the            system libraries, such as -static-libgcc or -shared-libgcc, are ignored.</p><p>The compiler may generate calls to "memcmp", "memset", "memcpy" and "memmove".  These entries are usually resolved by entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other            mechanism when this option is specified.</p><p>One of the standard libraries bypassed by -nostdlib and -nodefaultlibs is libgcc.a, a library of internal subroutines which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special            needs for some languages.</p><p>In  most  cases, you need libgcc.a even when you want to avoid other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs you should usually specify -lgcc as well.            This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines.  (An example of such an internal subroutine is "__main", used to ensure C++ constructors are called.)</p><p><b>`-nostdlib`</b>++            Do not implicitly link with standard C++ libraries.</p><p><b>`-e entry`</b>        <b>`--entry`</b>=entry            Specify that the program entry point is entry.  The argument is interpreted by the linker; the GNU linker accepts either a symbol name or an address.</p><p><b>`-pie`</b>            Produce a dynamically linked position independent executable on targets that support it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options used  for  compilation  (-fpie,            <b>`-fPIE`</b>, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.</p><p><b>`-no-pie`</b>            Don't produce a dynamically linked position independent executable.</p><p><b>`-static-pie`</b>            Produce  a  static  position  independent  executable  on targets that support it.  A static position independent executable is similar to a static executable, but can be loaded at any address            without a dynamic linker.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation (-fpie, -fPIE, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.</p><p><b>`-pthread`</b>            Link with the POSIX threads library.  This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets  this  option  also            sets flags for the preprocessor, so it should be used consistently for both compilation and linking.</p><p><b>`-r  Produce`</b> a relocatable object as output.  This is also known as partial linking.</p><p><b>`-rdynamic`</b>            Pass  the  flag  -export-dynamic  to  the  ELF linker, on targets that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is            needed for some uses of "dlopen" or to allow obtaining backtraces from within a program.</p><p><b>`-s  Remove`</b> all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.</p><p><b>`-static`</b>            On systems that support dynamic linking, this overrides -pie and prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.</p><p><b>`-shared`</b>            Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of            options used for compilation (-fpic, -fPIC, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.[1]</p><p><b>`-shared-libgcc`</b>        <b>`-static-libgcc`</b>            On systems that provide libgcc as a shared library, these options force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.  If no  shared  version  of  libgcc  was  built  when  the            compiler was configured, these options have no effect.</p><p>There  are  several  situations  in which an application should use the shared libgcc instead of the static version.  The most common of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch            exceptions across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries as well as the application itself should use the shared libgcc.</p><p>Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds -shared-libgcc whenever you build a shared library or a main executable, because C++ programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right  thing            to do.</p><p>If,  instead,  you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may find that they are not always linked with the shared libgcc.  If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a            non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not support option --eh-frame-hdr, it links the shared version of libgcc into shared libraries by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker            and optimizes away the linking with the shared version of libgcc, linking with the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to  propagate  through  such  shared  libraries,            without incurring relocation costs at library load time.</p><p>However,  if  a  library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, or using the option -shared-libgcc, such that it is linked with the            shared libgcc.</p><p><b>`-static-libasan`</b>            When the -fsanitize=address option is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against libasan.  If libasan is available as a shared library, and the -static  option  is  not            used,  then  this  links  against  the  shared  version  of  libasan.  The -static-libasan option directs the GCC driver to link libasan statically, without necessarily linking other libraries            statically.</p><p><b>`-static-libtsan`</b>            When the -fsanitize=thread option is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against libtsan.  If libtsan is available as a shared library, and the  -static  option  is  not            used,  then  this  links  against  the  shared  version  of  libtsan.  The -static-libtsan option directs the GCC driver to link libtsan statically, without necessarily linking other libraries            statically.</p><p><b>`-static-liblsan`</b>            When the -fsanitize=leak option is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against liblsan.  If liblsan is available as a shared library, and the -static option is not used,            then this links against the shared version of liblsan.  The -static-liblsan option directs the GCC driver to link liblsan statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.</p><p><b>`-static-libubsan`</b>            When the -fsanitize=undefined option is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against libubsan.  If libubsan is available as a shared library, and the  -static  option  is            not  used,  then this links against the shared version of libubsan.  The -static-libubsan option directs the GCC driver to link libubsan statically, without necessarily linking other libraries            statically.</p><p><b>`-static-libstdc`</b>++            When the g++ program is used to link a C++ program, it normally automatically links against libstdc++.  If libstdc++ is available as a shared library, and the -static option is not used,  then            this links against the shared version of libstdc++.  That is normally fine.  However, it is sometimes useful to freeze the version of libstdc++ used by the program without going all the way to            a fully static link.  The -static-libstdc++ option directs the g++ driver to link libstdc++ statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.</p><p><b>`-symbolic`</b>            Bind  references  to  global  symbols  when building a shared object.  Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor option -Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs).  Only a few            systems support this option.</p><p><b>`-T script`</b>            Use script as the linker script.  This option is supported by most systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board targets without an operating system, the -T option may  be            required when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.</p><p><b>`-Xlinker option`</b>            Pass option as an option to the linker.  You can use this to supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not recognize.</p><p>If  you  want  to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use -Xlinker twice, once for the option and once for the argument.  For example, to pass -assert definitions, you must            write -Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions.  It does not work to write -Xlinker "-assert definitions", because this passes the entire string as a single argument, which is not what the linker            expects.</p><p>When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass arguments to linker options using the option=value syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you  can  specify  -Xlinker            <b>`-Map`</b>=output.map rather than -Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map.  Other linkers may not support this syntax for command-line options.</p><p><b>`-Wl`</b>,option            Pass  option  as an option to the linker.  If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this syntax to pass an argument to the option.  For example,            <b>`-Wl`</b>,-Map,output.map passes -Map output.map to the linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.</p><pre><code>NOTE: In Ubuntu 8.10 and later versions, for LDFLAGS, the option -Wl,-z,relro is used.  To disable, use -Wl,-z,norelro.
</code></pre><p><b>`-u symbol`</b>            Pretend the symbol symbol is undefined, to force linking of library modules to define it.  You can use -u multiple times with different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.</p><p><b>`-z keyword`</b>            <b>`-z is`</b> passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword keyword.

The lookup order is as follows:</p><ol><li> For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current file is searched first.</li></ol><p>2.  For the quote form of the include directive, the directories specified by -iquote options are searched in left-to-right order, as they appear on the command line.</p><p>3.  Directories specified with -I options are scanned in left-to-right order.</p><p>4.  Directories specified with -isystem options are scanned in left-to-right order.</p><p>5.  Standard system directories are scanned.</p><p>6.  Directories specified with -idirafter options are scanned in left-to-right order.</p><p>You can use -I to override a system header file, substituting your own version, since these directories are searched before the standard system header file directories.   However,  you  should            not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use -isystem for that.</p><p>The -isystem and -idirafter options also mark the directory as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment that is applied to the standard system directories.</p><p>If  a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with -isystem, is also specified with -I, the -I option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a system directory            at its normal position in the system include chain.  This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the "#include_next" directive are not inadvertently            changed.  If you really need to change the search order for system directories, use the -nostdinc and/or -isystem options.</p><p><b>`-I- Split`</b> the include path.  This option has been deprecated.  Please use -iquote instead for -I directories before the -I- and remove the -I- option.</p><p>Any directories specified with -I options before -I- are searched only for headers requested with "#include "file""; they are not searched for "#include <file>".  If additional directories are            specified with -I options after the -I-, those directories are searched for all #include directives.</p><p>In addition, -I- inhibits the use of the directory of the current file directory as the first search directory for "#include "file"".  There is no way to override this effect of -I-.</p><p><b>`-iprefix prefix`</b>            Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix options.

Only the directories explicitly specified with -I, -iquote, -isystem, and/or -idirafter  options  (and  the  directory  of  the            current file, if appropriate) are searched.</p><p><b>`-nostdinc`</b>++            Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories, but do still search the other standard directories.

This option is not meant to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.</p><p><b>`-Ldir`</b>            Add directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for -l.</p><p><b>`-Bprefix`</b>            This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler itself.</p><p>The  compiler  driver program runs one or more of the subprograms cpp, cc1, as and ld.  It tries prefix as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and without machine/version/ for            the corresponding target machine and compiler version.</p><p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the -B prefix, if any.  If that name is not found,  or  if  -B  is  not  specified,  the  driver  tries  two  standard  prefixes,            /usr/lib/gcc/  and  /usr/local/lib/gcc/.   If  neither  of  those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program name is searched for using the directories specified in your PATH            environment variable.</p><p>The compiler checks to see if the path provided by -B refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory separator character at the end of the path.</p><p><b>`-B prefixes`</b> that effectively specify directory names also apply to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these options into -L options for the linker.  They  also  apply  to ` include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these options into -isystem options for the preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends include to the prefix.</p><p>The  runtime  support file libgcc.a can also be searched for using the -B prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left out of the link if it is not found by those means.</p><p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the -B prefix is to use the environment variable GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p><p>As a special kludge, if the path provided by -B is [dir/]stageN/, where N is a number in the range 0 to 9, then it is replaced by [dir/]include.   This  is  to  help  with  boot-strapping  the compiler. `</p><p><b>`-no-canonical-prefixes`</b>            Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to /../ or /./, or make the path absolute when generating a relative prefix.</p><p><b>`--sysroot`</b>=dir            Use  dir  as  the  logical  root directory for headers and libraries.  For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in /usr/include and libraries in /usr/lib, it instead searches            dir/usr/include and dir/usr/lib.</p><p>If you use both this option and the -isysroot option, then the --sysroot option applies to libraries, but the -isysroot option applies to header files.</p><p>The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the header file aspect of --sysroot still works,  but  the            library aspect does not.</p><p><b>`--no-sysroot-suffix`</b>            For  some  targets,  a  suffix  is added to the root directory specified with --sysroot, depending on the other options used, so that headers may for example be found in dir/suffix/usr/include            instead of dir/usr/include.  This option disables the addition of such a suffix.</p><p>Options for Code Generation Conventions ` These machine-independent options control the interface conventions used in code generation.</p><p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo is -fno-foo.  In the table below, only one of the forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You can  figure out the other form by either removing no- or adding it. `</p><p><b>`-fstack-reuse`</b>=reuse-level            This  option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables and compiler generated temporaries.  reuse_level can be all, named_vars, or none. all enables stack reuse for all            local variables and temporaries, named_vars enables the reuse only for user defined local variables with names, and none disables stack reuse completely. The default value is all.  The  option            is  needed when the program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of a variable ends,            and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does  not  overlap  with            it. Legacy code extending local lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.</p><p>For example,</p><p>int *p;                       {                         int local1;</p><p>p = &local1;                         local1 = 10;                         ....                       }                       {                          int local2;                          local2 = 20;                          ...                       }</p><p>if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1                         {</p><p>}</p><p>Another example:</p><p>struct A                       {                           A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }                           int i;                           int j;                       };</p><p>A *ap;</p><p>void foo(const A& ar)                       {                          ap = &ar;                       }</p><p>void bar()                       {                          foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns</p><p>{                            A a(20);                            ....                          }                          ap->i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space                                       // is reused with a. What is the value of ap->i?                       }</p><p>The  lifetime  of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C++ standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has the            freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on  the  behavior  of  older            compilers in which temporaries' stack space is not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.</p><p><b>`-ftrapv`</b>            This  option  generates  traps  for  signed  overflow on addition, subtraction, multiplication operations.  The options -ftrapv and -fwrapv override each other, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv on the            command-line results in -fwrapv being effective.  Note that only active options override, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv -fno-wrapv on the command-line results in -ftrapv being effective.</p><p><b>`-fwrapv`</b>            This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation.  This  flag  enables            some  optimizations  and disables others.  The options -ftrapv and -fwrapv override each other, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv on the command-line results in -fwrapv being effective.  Note that only            active options override, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv -fno-wrapv on the command-line results in -ftrapv being effective.</p><p><b>`-fwrapv-pointer`</b>            This option instructs the compiler to assume that pointer arithmetic overflow on addition  and  subtraction  wraps  around  using  twos-complement  representation.   This  flag  disables  some            optimizations which assume pointer overflow is invalid.</p><p><b>`-fstrict-overflow`</b>            This option implies -fno-wrapv -fno-wrapv-pointer and when negated implies -fwrapv -fwrapv-pointer.</p><p><b>`-fexceptions`</b>            Enable  exception  handling.   Generates  extra code needed to propagate exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC generates frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce            significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not specify this option, GCC enables it by default for languages like  C++  that  normally  require  exception            handling,  and  disables  it  for  languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with            exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't use exception handling.</p><p><b>`-fnon-call-exceptions`</b>            Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.  Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does  not  exist  everywhere.   Moreover,  it  only  allows            trapping  instructions  to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal handlers such as "SIGALRM".            This enables -fexceptions.</p><p><b>`-fdelete-dead-exceptions`</b>            Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.  This does not affect calls to functions except those            with the "pure" or "const" attributes.  This option is enabled by default for the Ada and C++ compilers, as permitted by the language  specifications.   Optimization  passes  that  cause  dead            exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.</p><p><b>`-funwind-tables`</b>            Similar  to  -fexceptions,  except  that  it  just  generates  any needed static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.  You normally do not need to enable this option;            instead, a language processor that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.</p><p><b>`-fasynchronous-unwind-tables`</b>            Generate unwind table in DWARF format, if supported by target machine.  The table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack unwinding from asynchronous events (such as            debugger or garbage collector).</p><p><b>`-fno-gnu-unique`</b>            On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++ compiler uses the "STB_GNU_UNIQUE" binding to make sure that definitions of template static data members and static local  variables            in  inline functions are unique even in the presence of "RTLD_LOCAL"; this is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different "RTLD_LOCAL" plugins depending on a definition in            one of them and therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the symbol.  But this causes "dlclose" to be ignored for affected DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization            of a DSO via "dlclose" and "dlopen", you can use -fno-gnu-unique.</p><p><b>`-fpcc-struct-return`</b>            Return "short" "struct" and "union" values in memory like longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less efficient, but it  has  the  advantage  of  allowing  intercallability            between GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly the Portable C Compiler (pcc).</p><p>The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends on the target configuration macros.</p><p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match that of some integer type.</p><p>Warning:  code  compiled  with  the  -fpcc-struct-return switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the -freg-struct-return switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application            binary interface.</p><p><b>`-freg-struct-return`</b>            Return "struct" and "union" values in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small structures than -fpcc-struct-return.</p><p>If you specify neither -fpcc-struct-return nor -freg-struct-return, GCC defaults to whichever convention is standard for the target.  If there  is  no  standard  convention,  GCC  defaults  to            <b>`-fpcc-struct-return`</b>, except on targets where GCC is the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and we chose the more efficient register return alternative.</p><pre><code>Warning:  code  compiled  with  the  -freg-struct-return switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the -fpcc-struct-return switch.

</code></pre><p><b>`-fshort-enums`</b>            Allocate to an "enum" type only as many bytes as it needs for the declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the "enum" type is equivalent to the smallest integer type that  has  enough            room.</p><p>Warning:  the  -fshort-enums  switch  causes  GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary            interface.</p><p><b>`-fshort-wchar`</b>            Override the underlying type for "wchar_t" to be "short unsigned int" instead of the default for the target.  This option is useful for building programs to run under WINE.</p><p>Warning: the -fshort-wchar switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.  Use it to conform  to  a  non-default  application  binary            interface.</p><p><b>`-fcommon`</b>            In  C  code,  this  option controls the placement of global variables defined without an initializer, known as tentative definitions in the C standard.  Tentative definitions are distinct from            declarations of a variable with the "extern" keyword, which do not allocate storage.</p><p>The default is -fno-common, which specifies that the compiler places uninitialized global variables in the BSS section of the object file.  This inhibits the merging of  tentative  definitions            by the linker so you get a multiple-definition error if the same variable is accidentally defined in more than one compilation unit.</p><p>The  -fcommon  places  uninitialized global variables in a common block.  This allows the linker to resolve all tentative definitions of the same variable in different compilation units to the            same object, or to a non-tentative definition.  This behavior is inconsistent with C++, and on many targets implies a speed and code size penalty on global variable references.  It  is  mainly            useful to enable legacy code to link without errors.</p><p><b>`-fno-ident`</b>            Ignore the "#ident" directive.</p><p><b>`-finhibit-size-directive`</b>            Don't  output  a  ".size" assembler directive, or anything else that would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.            This option is used when compiling crtstuff.c; you should not need to use it for anything else.</p><p><b>`-fverbose-asm`</b>            Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those who actually need to read the generated  assembly  code            (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).</p><p><b>`-fno-verbose-asm`</b>, the default, causes the extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler files.</p><pre><code>The added comments include:

Such code accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table            (GOT).  The dynamic loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating  system).   If  the  GOT  size  for  the  linked            executable  exceeds  a machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that -fpic does not work; in that case, recompile with -fPIC instead.  (These maximums            are 8k on the SPARC, 28k on AArch64 and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The x86 has no such limit.)</p><p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain machines.  For the x86, GCC supports PIC for System V but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for  the            IBM RS/6000 is always position-independent.</p><p>When this flag is set, the macros "__pic__" and "__PIC__" are defined to 1.</p><p><b>`-fPIC`</b>            If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the global offset table.

Instead, load the callee address at call sites from the GOT and branch to it.  This leads to more  efficient  code            by  eliminating  PLT stubs and exposing GOT loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as 32-bit x86 where PLT stubs expect the GOT pointer in a specific register, this gives more register            allocation freedom to the compiler.  Lazy binding requires use of the PLT; with -fno-plt all external symbols are resolved at load time.</p><p>Alternatively, the function attribute "noplt" can be used to avoid calls through the PLT for specific external functions.</p><p>In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to functions that are marked to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.</p><p><b>`-fno-jump-tables`</b>            Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is of use in conjunction with -fpic or -fPIC for building            code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.</p><p><b>`-fno-bit-tests`</b>            Do not use bit tests for switch statements even where it would be more efficient than other code generation strategies.</p><p><b>`-ffixed-reg`</b>            Treat the register named reg as a fixed register; generated code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).</p><p>reg must be the name of a register.

Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed  pervasive  roles  in  the  machine's  execution  model  produces            disastrous results.</p><p>A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for a register in which function values may be returned.</p><p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.</p><p><b>`-fpack-struct`</b>[=n]            Without  a  value specified, pack all structure members together without holes.

The model argument should be one of  global-dynamic,  local-dynamic,  initial-exec  or  local-exec.   Note  that  the  choice  is  subject  to            optimization: the compiler may use a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation unit, or if -fpic is not given on the command line.</p><p>The default without -fpic is initial-exec; with -fpic the default is global-dynamic.</p><p><b>`-ftrampolines`</b>            For  targets  that  normally  need trampolines for nested functions, always generate them instead of using descriptors.  Otherwise, for targets that do not need them, like for example HP-PA or            IA-64, do nothing.</p><p>A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is used to call the nested function  indirectly.   Therefore,            it requires the stack to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.</p><p><b>`-fno-trampolines  is`</b>  enabled  by  default  on  a  language  by  language  basis to let the compiler avoid generating them, if it computes that this is safe, and replace them with descriptors. ` Descriptors are made up of data only, but the generated code must be prepared to deal with them.  As of this writing, -fno-trampolines is enabled by default only for Ada.</p><p>Moreover, code compiled with -ftrampolines and code compiled with -fno-trampolines are not binary compatible if nested functions are present.  This option must therefore be used on a  program- wide basis and be manipulated with extreme care.</p><p>For  languages  other  than  Ada,  the  "-ftrampolines"  and  "-fno-trampolines"  options  currently have no effect, and trampolines are always generated on platforms that need them for nested functions. `</p><p><b>`-fvisibility`</b>=[default|internal|hidden|protected]            Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option---all symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.  Using this feature  can  very  substantially  improve            linking and load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.  It is strongly recommended that you use this in any            shared objects you distribute.</p><p>Despite  the  nomenclature,  default always means public; i.e., available to be linked against from outside the shared object.  protected and internal are pretty useless in real-world usage so            the only other commonly used option is hidden.  The default if -fvisibility isn't specified is default, i.e., make every symbol public.</p><p>A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols have the correct visibility is given by  "How  To  Write  Shared  Libraries"  by  Ulrich  Drepper  (which  can  be  found  at            <https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/>)---however a superior solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things            public.   This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with -fvisibility=hidden and "__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))" instead of "__declspec(dllexport)" you get almost identical semantics            with identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with cross-platform projects.</p><p>For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find "#pragma GCC visibility" of use.  This works by you enclosing the declarations you wish  to  set  visibility  for  with  (for            example)  "#pragma  GCC  visibility push(hidden)" and "#pragma GCC visibility pop".  Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed as part of the API interface contract and thus all new            code should always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations only for use within the local DSO should always  be  marked  explicitly  as  hidden  as  so  to  avoid  PLT            indirection  overheads---making  this  abundantly  clear  also  aids  readability  and  self-documentation of the code.  Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, "operator new" and            "operator delete" must always be of default visibility.</p><p>Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be expecting to be compiled with  visibility  other  than  the            default.  You may need to explicitly say "#pragma GCC visibility push(default)" before including any such headers.</p><p>"extern" declarations are not affected by -fvisibility, so a lot of code can be recompiled with -fvisibility=hidden with no modifications.  However, this means that calls to "extern" functions            with  no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more effective to use "__attribute ((visibility))" and/or "#pragma GCC visibility" to tell the compiler which "extern" declarations should be            treated as hidden.</p><p>Note that -fvisibility does affect C++ vague linkage entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is  be  thrown  between  DSOs  must  be  explicitly  marked  with  default            visibility so that the type_info nodes are unified between the DSOs.</p><p>An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them is at <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility>.</p><p><b>`-fstrict-volatile-bitfields`</b>            This  option  should  be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types anyway) should use a single access of the width of            the field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with  this  flag            you  can  declare  all  peripheral  bit-fields as "unsigned short" (assuming short is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit            access.</p><p>If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load instruction, even though that accesses  bytes  that  do  not            contain any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to the one being updated.</p><p>In  some  cases,  such  as when the "packed" attribute is applied to a structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single read or write that is correctly aligned for the            target machine.  In this case GCC falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that will fault or truncate the result at run time.</p><p>Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended to define all bits of the  field's  type  as            bit-field members.</p><p>The default value of this option is determined by the application binary interface for the target processor.</p><p><b>`-fsync-libcalls`</b>            This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the "__sync" family of functions may be used to implement the C++11 "__atomic" family of functions.</p><p>The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form of the option is -fno-sync-libcalls.  This option is used in the implementation of the libatomic runtime library.</p><p>GCC Developer Options ` This  section  describes  command-line  options  that are primarily of interest to GCC developers, including options to support compiler testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug dumps at various points in the compilation; that print statistics such as memory use and execution time; and that print  information about GCC's configuration, such as where it searches for libraries.  You should rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary compilation and linking tasks.</p><p>Many developer options that cause GCC to dump output to a file take an optional =filename suffix. You can specify stdout or - to dump to standard output, and stderr for standard error.</p><p>If  =filename  is  omitted,  a  default  dump file name is constructed by concatenating the base dump file name, a pass number, phase letter, and pass name.  The base dump file name is the name of output file produced by the compiler if explicitly specified and not an executable; otherwise it is the source file name.  The pass number is determined by the order passes are registered with the compiler's pass manager.  This is generally the same as the order of execution, but passes registered by plugins, target-specific passes, or passes that are otherwise registered late are  numbered higher  than the pass named final, even if they are executed earlier.  The phase letter is one of i (inter-procedural analysis), l (language-specific), r (RTL), or t (tree).  The files are created in the directory of the output file. `</p><p><b>`-fcallgraph-info`</b>        <b>`-fcallgraph-info`</b>=MARKERS            Makes the compiler output callgraph information for the program, on a per-object-file basis.  The information is generated in the common VCG format.  It can be decorated with additional,  per-            node  and/or  per-edge information, if a list of comma-separated markers is additionally specified.  When the "su" marker is specified, the callgraph is decorated with stack usage information;            it is equivalent to -fstack-usage.  When the "da" marker is specified, the callgraph is decorated with information about dynamically allocated objects.</p><p>When compiling with -flto, no callgraph information is output along with the object file.  At LTO link time,  -fcallgraph-info  may  generate  multiple  callgraph  information  files  next  to            intermediate LTO output files.</p><p><b>`-dletters`</b>        <b>`-fdump-rtl-pass`</b>        <b>`-fdump-rtl-pass`</b>=filename            Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by letters.

Invoke GCC with -fdump-passes and in the stderr output look for a code that corresponds to the pass you are interested in.  For example, the codes "tree-evrp", "tree-vrp1", and "tree-vrp2"                correspond to the three Value Range Propagation passes.  The number at the end distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass.</p><p>2.  To  enable  the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to the -fdump- option prefix and invoke GCC with it.  For example, to enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation                pass, invoke GCC with the -fdump-tree-evrp option.  Optionally, you may specify the name of the dump file.  If you don't specify one, GCC creates as described below.</p><p>3.  Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components separated by a period: the name of the source file GCC was invoked to compile, a numeric suffix indicating the  pass                number  followed  by  the  letter  t  for  tree  passes  (and  the  letter  r  for  RTL  passes),  and finally the pass code.  For example, the Early VRP pass dump might be in a file named                myfile.c.038t.evrp in the current working directory.  Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change from one version of GCC to another.</p><p><b>`-fopt-info`</b>        <b>`-fopt-info-options`</b>        <b>`-fopt-info-options`</b>=filename            Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the -options form is used, options is a list of - separated option keywords to select the dump details and optimizations.</p><p>The options can be divided into three groups:</p><ol><li> options describing what kinds of messages should be emitted,</li></ol><p>2.  options describing the verbosity of the dump, and</p><p>3.  options describing which optimizations should be included.</p><p>The options from each group can be freely mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts, the later options override the earlier options on the command line.</p><p>The following options control which kinds of messages should be emitted:</p><p>optimized                Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the vectorizer passes print the source location  of                loops which are successfully vectorized.</p><p>missed                Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes control which information to include in the output.</p><p>note                Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.</p><p>all Print detailed optimization information. This includes optimized, missed, and note.</p><p>The following option controls the dump verbosity:</p><p>internals                By default, only "high-level" messages are emitted. This option enables additional, more detailed, messages, which are likely to only be of interest to GCC developers.</p><p>One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a group of optimizations:</p><p>ipa Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.</p><p>loop                Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.</p><p>inline                Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.</p><p>omp Enable dumps from all OMP (Offloading and Multi Processing) optimizations.</p><p>vec Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.</p><p>optall                Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of the optimization groups listed above.</p><p>If options is omitted, it defaults to optimized-optall, which means to dump messages about successful optimizations from all the passes, omitting messages that are treated as "internals".</p><p>If  the  filename  is  provided,  then the dumps from all the applicable optimizations are concatenated into the filename.  Otherwise the dump is output onto stderr. Though multiple -fopt-info            options are accepted, only one of them can include a filename. If other filenames are provided then all but the first such option are ignored.</p><p>Note that the output filename is overwritten in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from multiple translation units is desired, stderr should be used instead.</p><p>In the following example, the optimization info is output to stderr:</p><p>gcc -O3 -fopt-info</p><p>This example:</p><p>gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all</p><p>outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into missed.all, and this one:</p><p>gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed</p><p>prints information about missed optimization opportunities from vectorization passes on stderr.  Note that -fopt-info-vec-missed is equivalent  to  -fopt-info-missed-vec.   The  order  of  the            optimization group names and message types listed after -fopt-info does not matter.</p><p>As another example,</p><p>gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt</p><p>outputs information about missed optimizations as well as optimized locations from all the inlining passes into inline.txt.</p><p>Finally, consider:</p><p>gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt</p><p>Here  the  two  output  filenames  vec.miss  and loop.opt are in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are            ignored. Thus only vec.miss is produced which contains dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.</p><p><b>`-fsave-optimization-record`</b>            Write a SRCFILE.opt-record.json.gz file detailing what optimizations were performed, for those optimizations that support -fopt-info.</p><p>This option is experimental and the format of the data within the compressed JSON file is subject to change.</p><p>It is roughly equivalent to a machine-readable version of -fopt-info-all, as a collection of messages with source file, line number and column number, with the following  additional  data  for            each message:</p><p>*   the execution count of the code being optimized, along with metadata about whether this was from actual profile data, or just an estimate, allowing consumers to prioritize messages by code                hotness,</p><p>*   the function name of the code being optimized, where applicable,</p><p>*   the  "inlining chain" for the code being optimized, so that when a function is inlined into several different places (which might themselves be inlined), the reader can distinguish between                the copies,</p><p>*   objects identifying those parts of the message that refer to expressions, statements or symbol-table nodes, which of these categories they are,  and,  when  available,  their  source  code                location,</p><p>*   the GCC pass that emitted the message, and</p><p>*   the location in GCC's own code from which the message was emitted</p><p>Additionally, some messages are logically nested within other messages, reflecting implementation details of the optimization passes.</p><p><b>`-fsched-verbose`</b>=n            On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the amount of debugging output the scheduler prints to the dump files.</p><p>For  n  greater  than zero, -fsched-verbose outputs the same information as -fdump-rtl-sched1 and -fdump-rtl-sched2.

This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack offset would give you better code, but to actually  use  a  different  stack            offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the toolchain with the appropriate --with-stack-offset=num option.</p><p><b>`-mno-round-nearest`</b>            Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to truncating.

This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected at function call and return time.  Making this mode  match  the  mode            you predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.</p><p>mode can be set to one the following values:</p><p>caller                Any  mode  at  function  entry  is  valid,  and  retained  or  restored  when the function returns, and when it calls other functions.  This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other                compilation units you might want to incorporate into different programs with different prevailing FPU modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single  object  file  outweighs  the                size and speed overhead for any extra mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed with a more specific choice of prevailing FPU mode.</p><p>truncate                This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.

Permissible values are: apcs-gnu, atpcs, aapcs, aapcs-linux and iwmmxt.</p><p><b>`-mapcs-frame`</b>            Generate  a  stack  frame  that  is  compliant  with  the  ARM  Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying            <b>`-fomit-frame-pointer with`</b> this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for leaf functions.  The default is -mno-apcs-frame.  This option is deprecated.</p><p><b>`-mapcs`</b>            This is a synonym for -mapcs-frame and is deprecated.</p><p><b>`-mthumb-interwork`</b>            Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre-v5 architectures, the two instruction sets  cannot  be  reliably  used  inside  one            program.  The default is -mno-thumb-interwork, since slightly larger code is generated when -mthumb-interwork is specified.  In AAPCS configurations this option is meaningless.</p><p><b>`-mno-sched-prolog`</b>            Prevent  the  reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's body.  This means that all functions start with a            recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of different function prologues), and this information can be used to locate the  start  of  functions  inside  an            executable piece of code.  The default is -msched-prolog.</p><p><b>`-mfloat-abi`</b>=name            Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values are: soft, softfp and hard.</p><p>Specifying  soft  causes  GCC  to  generate output containing library calls for floating-point operations.  softfp allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point instructions, but            still uses the soft-float calling conventions.  hard allows generation of floating-point instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.</p><p>The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire program with  the  same  ABI,  and            link with a compatible set of libraries.</p><p><b>`-mgeneral-regs-only`</b>            Generate  code  which uses only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced SIMD registers but will not impose any restrictions on the            assembler.</p><p><b>`-mlittle-endian`</b>            Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is the default for all standard configurations.</p><p><b>`-mbig-endian`</b>            Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.</p><p><b>`-mbe8`</b>        <b>`-mbe32`</b>            When linking a big-endian image select between BE8 and BE32 formats.  The option has no effect for little-endian images and is ignored.   The  default  is  dependent  on  the  selected  target            architecture.  For ARMv6 and later architectures the default is BE8, for older architectures the default is BE32.  BE32 format has been deprecated by ARM.</p><p><b>`-march`</b>=name[+extension...]            This  specifies  the  name  of  the  target  ARM architecture.  GCC uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  This option can be used in            conjunction with or instead of the -mcpu= option.</p><p>Permissible names are: armv4t, armv5t, armv5te, armv6, armv6j, armv6k, armv6kz, armv6t2, armv6z,  armv6zk,  armv7,  armv7-a,  armv7ve,  armv8-a,  armv8.1-a,  armv8.2-a,  armv8.3-a,  armv8.4-a,            armv8.5-a, armv8.6-a, armv9-a, armv7-r, armv8-r, armv6-m, armv6s-m, armv7-m, armv7e-m, armv8-m.base, armv8-m.main, armv8.1-m.main, armv9-a, iwmmxt and iwmmxt2.</p><p>Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support for the Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is deprecated: armv4.</p><p>Many  of  the architectures support extensions.  These can be added by appending +extension to the architecture name.  Extension options are processed in order and capabilities accumulate.  An            extension will also enable any necessary base extensions upon which it depends.  For example, the +crypto extension will always enable the +simd  extension.   The  exception  to  the  additive            construction is for extensions that are prefixed with +no...: these extensions disable the specified option and any other extensions that may depend on the presence of that extension.</p><p>For example, -march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4 is equivalent to writing -march=armv7-a+vfpv4 since the +simd option is entirely disabled by the +nofp option that follows it.</p><p>Most extension names are generically named, but have an effect that is dependent upon the architecture to which it is applied.  For example, the +simd option can be applied to both armv7-a and            armv8-a architectures, but will enable the original ARMv7-A Advanced SIMD (Neon) extensions for armv7-a and the ARMv8-A variant for armv8-a.</p><p>The table below lists the supported extensions for each architecture.

The address of a function or label is represented as word address so that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the range of  64 Ki words.</p><p>In  order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128 Ki bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called "EIND" that serves as most significant part of the target address when "EICALL" or "EIJMP" instructions are used.</p><p>Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by the compiler and are subject to some limitations: `</p><p>*   The compiler never sets "EIND".</p><p>*   The compiler uses "EIND" implicitly in "EICALL"/"EIJMP" instructions or might read "EIND" directly in order to emulate an indirect call/jump by means of a "RET" instruction.</p><p>*   The compiler assumes that "EIND" never changes during the startup code or during the application. In particular,  "EIND"  is  not  saved/restored  in  function  or  interrupt  service  routine            prologue/epilogue.</p><p>*   For  indirect  calls  to functions and computed goto, the linker generates stubs. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called trampolines. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.  The            stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.</p><p>*   Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker generates the stubs correctly in all situations. See the compiler option -mrelax and the linker option --relax.  There are  corner  cases            where the linker is supposed to generate stubs but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.</p><p>*   The  default linker script is arranged for code with "EIND = 0".  If code is supposed to work for a setup with "EIND != 0", a custom linker script has to be used in order to place the sections            whose name start with ".trampolines" into the segment where "EIND" points to.</p><p>*   The startup code from libgcc never sets "EIND".  Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.  For the impact of  AVR-LibC  on  "EIND",  see  the  AVR-LibC user manual            ("https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/").</p><p>*   It  is  legitimate  for user-specific startup code to set up "EIND" early, for example by means of initialization code located in section ".init3". Such code runs prior to general startup code            that initializes RAM and calls constructors, but after the bit of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets "EIND" to the segment where the vector table is located.</p><p>#include <avr/io.h></p><p>static void                    __attribute__((section(".init3"),naked,used,no_instrument_function))                    init3_set_eind (void)                    {                      __asm volatile ("ldi r24,pm_hh8(__trampolines_start)\n\t"                                      "out %i0,r24" :: "n" (&EIND) : "r24","memory");                    }</p><p>The "__trampolines_start" symbol is defined in the linker script.</p><p>*   Stubs are generated automatically by the linker if the following two conditions are met:</p><p>-<The address of a label is taken by means of the "gs" modifier>                (short for generate stubs) like so:</p><p>LDI r24, lo8(gs(<func>))                        LDI r25, hi8(gs(<func>))</p><p>-<The final location of that label is in a code segment>                outside the segment where the stubs are located.</p><p>*   The compiler emits such "gs" modifiers for code labels in the following situations:</p><p>-<Taking address of a function or code label.>            -<Computed goto.>            -<If prologue-save function is used, see -mcall-prologues>                command-line option.</p><p>-<Switch/case dispatch tables.

To access memory locations outside this 64 KiB range, the content of a "RAMP" register is used as high part of the address: The "X", "Y", "Z" address register is concatenated with the "RAMPX", "RAMPY", "RAMPZ" special function register, respectively, to get a wide  address.  Similarly, "RAMPD" is used together with direct addressing. `</p><p>*   The startup code initializes the "RAMP" special function registers with zero.</p><p>*   If a AVR Named Address Spaces,named address space other than generic or "__flash" is used, then "RAMPZ" is set as needed before the operation.</p><p>*   If the device supports RAM larger than 64 KiB and the compiler needs to change "RAMPZ" to accomplish an operation, "RAMPZ" is reset to zero after the operation.</p><p>*   If the device comes with a specific "RAMP" register, the ISR prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it with zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.</p><p>*   RAM larger than 64 KiB is not supported by GCC for AVR targets.  If you use inline assembler to read from locations outside the 16-bit address range and change one of the "RAMP" registers, you            must reset it to zero after the access.</p><p>` AVR Built-in Macros</p><p>GCC  defines  several  built-in macros so that the user code can test for the presence or absence of features.  Almost any of the following built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities and thus triggered by the -mmcu= command-line option.</p><p>For even more AVR-specific built-in macros see AVR Named Address Spaces and AVR Built-in Functions.</p><p>"__AVR_ARCH__"     Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that identifies the architecture and depends on the -mmcu=mcu option.

If mcu specifies a device, this built-in macro is set accordingly. For  example,     with -mmcu=atmega8 the macro is defined to 4.</p><p>"__AVR_Device__"     Setting  -mmcu=device  defines  this  built-in  macro  which  reflects  the  device's  name.  For  example, -mmcu=atmega8 defines the built-in macro "__AVR_ATmega8__", -mmcu=attiny261a defines     "__AVR_ATtiny261A__", etc.</p><p>The built-in macros' names follow the scheme "__AVR_Device__" where Device is the device name as from the AVR user manual. The difference between Device in the built-in  macro  and  device  in     -mmcu=device is that the latter is always lowercase.</p><p>If device is not a device but only a core architecture like avr51, this macro is not defined.</p><p>"__AVR_DEVICE_NAME__"     Setting -mmcu=device defines this built-in macro to the device's name. For example, with -mmcu=atmega8 the macro is defined to "atmega8".</p><p>If device is not a device but only a core architecture like avr51, this macro is not defined.</p><p>"__AVR_XMEGA__"     The device / architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of devices.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_ADIW__"     The device has the "ADIW" and "SBIW" instructions.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_ELPM__"     The device has the "ELPM" instruction.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_ELPMX__"     The device has the "ELPM Rn,Z" and "ELPM Rn,Z+" instructions.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_LPMX__"     The device has the "LPM Rn,Z" and "LPM Rn,Z+" instructions.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_MOVW__"     The device has the "MOVW" instruction to perform 16-bit register-register moves.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_MUL__"     The device has a hardware multiplier.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__"     The device has the "JMP" and "CALL" instructions.  This is the case for devices with more than 8 KiB of program memory.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_EIJMP_EICALL__" "__AVR_3_BYTE_PC__"     The device has the "EIJMP" and "EICALL" instructions.  This is the case for devices with more than 128 KiB of program memory.  This also means that the program counter (PC) is 3 bytes wide.</p><p>"__AVR_2_BYTE_PC__"     The program counter (PC) is 2 bytes wide. This is the case for devices with up to 128 KiB of program memory.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_8BIT_SP__" "__AVR_HAVE_16BIT_SP__"     The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit respectively 16-bit register by the compiler.  The definition of these macros is affected by -mtiny-stack.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_SPH__" "__AVR_SP8__"     The  device  has  the  SPH  (high part of stack pointer) special function register or has an 8-bit stack pointer, respectively.  The definition of these macros is affected by -mmcu= and in the     cases of -mmcu=avr2 and -mmcu=avr25 also by -msp8.</p><p>"__AVR_HAVE_RAMPD__" "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPX__" "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPY__" "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPZ__"     The device has the "RAMPD", "RAMPX", "RAMPY", "RAMPZ" special function register, respectively.</p><p>"__NO_INTERRUPTS__"     This macro reflects the -mno-interrupts command-line option.</p><p>"__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP__" "__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP_JMP_CALL__"     Some AVR devices (AT90S8515, ATmega103) must not skip 32-bit instructions because of a hardware erratum.  Skip instructions are "SBRS", "SBRC", "SBIS", "SBIC" and "CPSE".  The second macro  is     only defined if "__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__" is also set.</p><p>"__AVR_ISA_RMW__"     The device has Read-Modify-Write instructions (XCH, LAC, LAS and LAT).</p><p>"__AVR_SFR_OFFSET__=offset"     Instructions  that  can  address  I/O special function registers directly like "IN", "OUT", "SBI", etc. may use a different address as if addressed by an instruction to access RAM like "LD" or     "STS". This offset depends on the device architecture and has to be subtracted from the RAM address in order to get the respective I/O address.</p><p>"__AVR_SHORT_CALLS__"     The -mshort-calls command line option is set.</p><p>"__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__=addr"     Some devices support reading from flash memory by means of "LD*" instructions.  The flash memory is seen in the data address space at an offset of "__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__".  If this macro  is     not  defined,  this  feature is not available.  If defined, the address space is linear and there is no need to put ".rodata" into RAM.  This is handled by the default linker description file,     and is currently available for "avrtiny" and "avrxmega3".  Even more convenient, there is no need to use address spaces like "__flash" or features like attribute "progmem" and "pgm_read_*".</p><p>"__WITH_AVRLIBC__"     The compiler is configured to be used together with AVR-Libc.  See the --with-avrlibc configure option.</p><p>"__HAVE_DOUBLE_MULTILIB__"     Defined if -mdouble= acts as a multilib option.</p><p>"__HAVE_DOUBLE32__" "__HAVE_DOUBLE64__"     Defined if the compiler supports 32-bit double resp. 64-bit double.  The actual layout is specified by option -mdouble=.</p><p>"__DEFAULT_DOUBLE__"     The size in bits of "double" if -mdouble= is not set.  To test the layout of "double" in a program, use the built-in macro "__SIZEOF_DOUBLE__".</p><p>"__HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE32__" "__HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE64__" "__HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE_MULTILIB__" "__DEFAULT_LONG_DOUBLE__"     Same as above, but for "long double" instead of "double".</p><p>"__WITH_DOUBLE_COMPARISON__"     Reflects the "--with-double-comparison={tristate|bool|libf7}" configure option ("https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html#avr") and is defined to 2 or 3.</p><p>"__WITH_LIBF7_LIBGCC__" "__WITH_LIBF7_MATH__" "__WITH_LIBF7_MATH_SYMBOLS__"     Reflects the "--with-libf7={libgcc|math|math-symbols}" configure option ("https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html#avr").</p><p>AVR Internal Options</p><p>The following options are used internally by the compiler and to communicate between device specs files and the compiler proper.

It is disabled by default.</p><p><b>`-msim`</b>            Links the library libsemi.a which is in compatible with simulator. Applicable to ELF compiler only.</p><p>` Darwin Options</p><p>These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating system.</p><p>FSF GCC on Darwin does not create "fat" object files; it creates an object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create "fat" files if multiple -arch options are used; it does so by running the compiler or linker multiple times and joining the results together with lipo.</p><p>The subtype of the file created (like ppc7400 or ppc970 or i686) is determined by the flags that specify the ISA that GCC is targeting, like -mcpu or -march.  The -force_cpusubtype_ALL option  can be used to override this.</p><p>The  Darwin  tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA mismatch.  The assembler, as, only permits instructions to be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating, so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a ppc750 object file.  The linker for shared libraries, /usr/bin/libtool, fails and prints an error if asked  to  create  a  shared  library  with  a  less restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put a ppc970 object file in a ppc7400 library).  The linker for executables, ld, quietly gives the executable the most restrictive subtype of any of its input files. `</p><p><b>`-Fdir`</b>            Add the framework directory dir to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are interleaved with those specified by -I options and are scanned in            a left-to-right order.</p><p>A  framework  directory  is a directory with frameworks in it.  A framework is a directory with a Headers and/or PrivateHeaders directory contained directly in it that ends in .framework.  The            name of a framework is the name of this directory excluding the .framework.  Headers associated with the framework are found in one of those two directories, with Headers being searched first.            A subframework is a framework directory that is in a framework's Frameworks directory.  Includes of subframework headers can  only  appear  in  a  header  of  a  framework  that  contains  the            subframework,  or in a sibling subframework header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a framework; a warning            is issued if this is violated.  Currently a subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism may be extended to support this.  The  standard  frameworks  can  be  found  in            /System/Library/Frameworks  and  /Library/Frameworks.  An example include looks like "#include <Framework/header.h>", where Framework denotes the name of the framework and header.h is found in            the PrivateHeaders or Headers directory.</p><p><b>`-iframeworkdir`</b>            Like -F except the directory is a treated as a system directory.  The main difference between this -iframework and -F is that with -iframework the  compiler  does  not  warn  about  constructs            contained within header files found via dir.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.</p><p><b>`-gused`</b>            Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs debugging format, this enables -feliminate-unused-debug-symbols.  This is by default ON.</p><p><b>`-gfull`</b>            Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.</p><p><b>`-fconstant-cfstrings`</b>            The -fconstant-cfstrings is an alias for -mconstant-cfstrings.</p><p><b>`-mconstant-cfstrings`</b>            When the NeXT runtime is being used (the default on these systems), override any -fconstant-string-class setting and cause "@"...""  literals to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.</p><p><b>`-mmacosx-version-min`</b>=version            The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on is version.  Typical values supported for version include 12, 10.12, and 10.5.8.</p><p>If  the  compiler  was  built  to use the system's headers by default, then the default for this option is the system version on which the compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make            choices that are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.</p><p><b>`-mkernel`</b>            Enable kernel development mode.  The -mkernel option sets -static, -fno-common, -fno-use-cxa-atexit, -fno-exceptions, -fno-non-call-exceptions,  -fapple-kext,  -fno-weak  and  -fno-rtti  where            applicable.  This mode also sets -mno-altivec, -msoft-float, -fno-builtin and -mlong-branch for PowerPC targets.</p><p><b>`-mone-byte-bool`</b>            Override the defaults for "bool" so that "sizeof(bool)==1".  By default sizeof(bool) is 4 when compiling for Darwin/PowerPC and 1 when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option has no effect on            x86.</p><p>Warning:  The  -mone-byte-bool  switch  causes  GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all other            modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this switch to conform to a non-default data model.</p><p><b>`-mfix-and-continue`</b>        <b>`-ffix-and-continue`</b>        <b>`-findirect-data`</b>            Generate code suitable for fast turnaround development, such as to allow GDB to dynamically load .o files into already-running programs.  -findirect-data and  -ffix-and-continue  are  provided            for backwards compatibility.</p><p><b>`-all`</b>_load            Loads all members of static archive libraries.

When -msoft-float is specified, functions in libgcc.a are used to perform floating-point operations.            Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point  operations.            If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call them.</p><p>Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are required to have floating-point registers.</p><p><b>`-mfp-reg`</b>        <b>`-mno-fp-regs`</b>            Generate  code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.  -mno-fp-regs implies -msoft-float.  If the floating-point register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed            in integer registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard calling  sequence,  so  any  function  with  a  floating-point            argument or return value called by code compiled with -mno-fp-regs must also be compiled with that option.</p><p>A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use, and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.</p><p><b>`-mieee`</b>            The  Alpha  architecture  implements  floating-point  hardware  optimized for maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE floating-point standard.  However, for full compliance,            software assistance is required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code except that the inexact-flag  is  not  maintained  (see  below).   If  this  option  is  turned  on,  the            preprocessor  macro  "_IEEE_FP"  is  defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE values such as            not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha compilers call this option -ieee_with_no_inexact.</p><p>DEBIAN SPECIFIC: This option is on by default for alpha-linux-gnu, unless -ffinite-math-only (which is part of the -ffast-math set) is specified, because the software functions in the GNU libc            math libraries generate denormalized numbers, NaNs, and infs (all of which will cause a programs to SIGFPE when it attempts to use the results without -mieee).</p><p><b>`-mieee-with-inexact`</b>            This is like -mieee except the generated code also maintains the IEEE inexact-flag.  Turning on this option causes the generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.   In  addition  to            "_IEEE_FP",  "_IEEE_FP_EXACT"  is defined as a preprocessor macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since            there is very little code that depends on the inexact-flag, you should normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this option -ieee_with_inexact.</p><p><b>`-mfp-trap-mode`</b>=trap-mode            This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.  Other Alpha compilers call this option -fptm trap-mode.  The trap mode can be set to one of four values:</p><p>n   This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero trap).</p><p>u   In addition to the traps enabled by n, underflow traps are enabled as well.</p><p>su  Like u, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).</p><p>sui Like su, but inexact traps are enabled as well.</p><p><b>`-mfp-rounding-mode`</b>=rounding-mode            Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option -fprm rounding-mode.  The rounding-mode can be one of:</p><p>n   Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case of a tie.</p><p>m   Round towards minus infinity.</p><p>c   Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.</p><p>d   Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register (fpcr, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this                register for rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the fpcr, d corresponds to round towards plus infinity.</p><p><b>`-mtrap-precision`</b>=trap-precision            In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a floating trap and program execution normally needs  to            be  terminated.   GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.  Depending on the requirements of an            application, different levels of precisions can be selected:</p><p>p   Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.</p><p>f   Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that caused a floating-point exception.</p><p>i   Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact instruction that caused a floating-point exception.</p><p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called -scope_safe and -resumption_safe.</p><p><b>`-mieee-conformant`</b>            This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not use this option unless you also specify -mtrap-precision=i and either -mfp-trap-mode=su or -mfp-trap-mode=sui.  Its  only            effect is to emit the line .eflag 48 in the function prologue of the generated assembly file.</p><p><b>`-mbuild-constants`</b>            Normally  GCC  examines  a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal            and generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.</p><p>Use this option to require GCC to construct all integer constants using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).</p><p>You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory before it can find the variables and constants  in  its  own            data segment.</p><p><b>`-mbwx`</b>        <b>`-mno-bwx`</b>        <b>`-mcix`</b>        <b>`-mno-cix`</b>        <b>`-mfix`</b>        <b>`-mno-fix`</b>        <b>`-mmax`</b>        <b>`-mno-max`</b>            Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX, CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction sets supported by the CPU type specified via -mcpu=            option or that of the CPU on which GCC was built if none is specified.</p><p><b>`-mfloat-vax`</b>        <b>`-mfloat-ieee`</b>            Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating-point arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.</p><p><b>`-mexplicit-relocs`</b>        <b>`-mno-explicit-relocs`</b>            Older  Alpha  assemblers  provided  no  way  to generate symbol relocations except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of            version 2.12 supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC detects            the capabilities of the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.</p><p><b>`-msmall-data`</b>        <b>`-mlarge-data`</b>            When -mexplicit-relocs is in effect, static data is accessed via gp-relative relocations.  When -msmall-data is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed  in  a  small  data  area  (the            ".sdata"  and  ".sbss"  sections) and are accessed via 16-bit relocations off of the $gp register.  This limits the size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be directly            accessed via a single instruction.</p><p>The default is -mlarge-data.  With this option the data area is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of data must use "malloc" or "mmap" to allocate the data in  the            heap instead of in the program's data segment.</p><p>When generating code for shared libraries, -fpic implies -msmall-data and -fPIC implies -mlarge-data.</p><p><b>`-msmall-text`</b>        <b>`-mlarge-text`</b>            When  -msmall-text  is  used,  the  compiler assumes that the code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When -msmall-data is            used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the same $gp value, and thus reduce the number of instructions required for a function call from 4 to 1.</p><p>The default is -mlarge-text.</p><p><b>`-mcpu`</b>=cpu_type            Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type.  You can specify either the EV style name or the corresponding chip number.   GCC  supports  scheduling            parameters  for  the  EV4,  EV5 and EV6 family of processors and chooses the default values for the instruction set from the processor you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, GCC            defaults to the processor on which the compiler was built.</p><p>Supported values for cpu_type are</p><p>ev4            ev45            21064                Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set extensions.</p><p>ev5            21164                Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set extensions.</p><p>ev56            21164a                Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.</p><p>pca56            21164pc            21164PC                Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX extensions.</p><p>ev6            21264                Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX, and MAX extensions.</p><p>ev67            21264a                Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, CIX, FIX, and MAX extensions.</p><p>Native toolchains also support the value native, which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.  -mcpu=native has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.</p><p><b>`-mtune`</b>=cpu_type            Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type.  The instruction set is not changed.</p><p>Native toolchains also support the value native, which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.  -mtune=native has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.</p><p><b>`-mmemory-latency`</b>=time            Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory references as seen by the application.  This number is highly dependent on the memory access patterns used  by  the  application            and the size of the external cache on the machine.</p><p>Valid options for time are</p><p>number                A decimal number representing clock cycles.</p><p>L1            L2            L3            main                The  compiler  contains  estimates of the number of clock cycles for "typical" EV4 & EV5 hardware for the Level 1, 2 & 3 caches (also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main                memory.  Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.</p><pre><code>eBPF Options

Multiple register ranges can be specified separated by a comma.</p><p><b>`-mgas`</b>            Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.</p><p><b>`-mgnu-ld`</b>            Use options specific to GNU ld.  This passes -shared to ld when building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or  implicitly,  with  the  GNU  linker.   This            option  does  not affect which ld is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the --with-ld configure option, GCC's program search            path, and finally by the user's PATH.  The linker used by GCC can be printed using which <code>gcc -print-prog-name=ld</code>.  This option is only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with            hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p><p><b>`-mhp-ld`</b>            Use options specific to HP ld.  This passes -b to ld when building a shared library and passes +Accept TypeMismatch to ld on all links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or            implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not affect which ld is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined  by  the  --with-ld            configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's PATH.

Note this makes symbolic debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they give bogus error            messages when linking some programs.</p><p><b>`-mlong-calls`</b>            Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate long calls only when the  distance  from  the            call site to the beginning of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and            240,000 bytes, respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000 bytes.</p><p>Distances  are  measured  from the beginning of functions when using the -ffunction-sections option, or when using the -mgas and -mno-portable-runtime options together under HP-UX with the SOM            linker.</p><p>It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades performance.  However, it may be useful  in  large  applications,  particularly  when  partial  linking  is  used  to  build  the            application.</p><p>The  types  of  long calls used depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long            pic symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.  However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code and it is quite long.</p><p><b>`-mlong-load-store`</b>            Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by the HP-UX 10 linker.

The choices for cpu-type are 700 7100, 7100LC, 7200, 7300 and 8000.   Refer  to  /usr/lib/sched.models  on  an  HP-UX            system to determine the proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is 8000.</p><p><b>`-msio`</b>            Generate  the  predefine,  "_SIO",  for  server IO.  The default is -mwsio.  This generates the predefines, "__hp9000s700", "__hp9000s700__" and "_WSIO", for workstation IO.  These options are            available under HP-UX and HI-UX.</p><p><b>`-msoft-float`</b>            Generate output containing library calls for floating point.  Warning: the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA targets.   Normally  the  facilities  of  the  machine's  usual  C            compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for cross-compilation.</p><p><b>`-msoft-float changes`</b> the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile all of a program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile libgcc.a, the <code> library that comes with GCC, with -msoft-float in order for this to work. </code></p><p><b>`-msoft-mult`</b>            Use software integer multiplication.</p><p>This disables the use of the "xmpyu" instruction.</p><p><b>`-munix`</b>=unix-std            Generate  compiler  predefines  and select a startfile for the specified UNIX standard.  The choices for unix-std are 93, 95 and 98.  93 is supported on all HP-UX versions.  95 is available on            HP-UX 10.10 and later.  98 is available on HP-UX 11.11 and later.

It also affects the operational behavior of the C library.  Thus, extreme care is needed in using this option.</p><p>Library code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX standard must test, set and restore the variable "__xpg4_extended_mask" as appropriate.  Most GNU software doesn't provide this capability. `</p><p><b>`-nolibdld`</b>            Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the -static option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.</p><p><b>`-static`</b>            The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus, when the -static option is specified, special link options are            needed to resolve this dependency.</p><p>On  HP-UX  10  and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to link with libdld.sl when the -static option is specified.  This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit            port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The -nolibdld option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from adding these link options.</p><p><b>`-threads`</b>            Add support for multithreading with the dce thread library under HP-UX.

These pseudo-registers are used like real registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit            the code into available registers, and the performance penalty of using memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a program must be compiled with the same value for  this  option.

The code can be interlinked with either FP32 or FP64, but not both.  The FP64A extension is similar to            the FP64 extension but forbids the use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.

Normally such constants are signed decimals, but this option is available for testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.</p><p><b>`-mmcu`</b>=            Select  the  MCU  to  target.   This  is  used  to create a C preprocessor symbol based upon the MCU name, converted to upper case and pre- and post-fixed with __.  This in turn is used by the            msp430.h header file to select an MCU-specific supplementary header file.</p><p>The option also sets the ISA to use.  If the MCU name is one that is known to only support the 430 ISA then that is selected, otherwise the 430X ISA is selected.  A generic MCU name of  msp430            can also be used to select the 430 ISA.  Similarly the generic msp430x MCU name selects the 430X ISA.</p><p>In  addition  an MCU-specific linker script is added to the linker command line.  The script's name is the name of the MCU with .ld appended.  Thus specifying -mmcu=xxx on the gcc command line            defines the C preprocessor symbol "__XXX__" and cause the linker to search for a script called xxx.ld.</p><p>The ISA and hardware multiply supported for the different MCUs is hard-coded into GCC.  However, an external devices.csv file can be used to extend device support beyond those that  have  been            hard-coded.</p><p>GCC searches for the devices.csv file using the following methods in the given precedence order, where the first method takes precendence over the second which takes precedence over the third.</p><p>Include path specified with "-I" and "-L"                devices.csv will be searched for in each of the directories specified by include paths and linker library search paths.</p><p>Path specified by the environment variable MSP430_GCC_INCLUDE_DIR                Define the value of the global environment variable MSP430_GCC_INCLUDE_DIR to the full path to the directory containing devices.csv, and GCC will search this directory for devices.csv.  If                devices.csv  is  found, this directory will also be registered as an include path, and linker library path.  Header files and linker scripts in this directory can therefore be used without                manually specifying "-I" and "-L" on the command line.</p><p>The msp430-elf{,bare}/include/devices directory                Finally, GCC will examine msp430-elf{,bare}/include/devices from the toolchain root directory.  This directory does not exist in a default installation, but if the user has created it  and                copied devices.csv there, then the MCU data will be read.  As above, this directory will also be registered as an include path, and linker library path.</p><p>If none of the above search methods find devices.csv, then the hard-coded MCU data is used.</p><p><b>`-mwarn-mcu`</b>        <b>`-mno-warn-mcu`</b>            This  option enables or disables warnings about conflicts between the MCU name specified by the -mmcu option and the ISA set by the -mcpu option and/or the hardware multiply support set by the            <b>`-mhwmult option`</b>.  It also toggles warnings about unrecognized MCU names.  This option is on by default.</p><p><b>`-mcpu`</b>=            Specifies the ISA to use.  Accepted values are msp430, msp430x and msp430xv2.  This option is deprecated.  The -mmcu= option should be used to select the ISA.</p><p><b>`-msim`</b>            Link to the simulator runtime libraries and linker script.  Overrides any scripts that would be selected by the -mmcu= option.</p><p><b>`-mlarge`</b>            Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 20-bit "size_t").</p><p><b>`-msmall`</b>            Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit "size_t").</p><p><b>`-mrelax`</b>            This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows the linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done until the final link.</p><p>` mhwmult=     Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the target.  Accepted values are none for no hardware multiply, 16bit for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early MCUs.  32bit     for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and f5series for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by F5-series MCUs.  A value of auto can also be  given.   This  tells  GCC  to  deduce  the     hardware  multiply  support  based  upon  the  MCU name provided by the -mmcu option.  If no -mmcu option is specified or if the MCU name is not recognized then no hardware multiply support is     assumed.  "auto" is the default setting.</p><p>Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a library routine.  This saves space in the generated code.  When compiling at -O3 or higher however the hardware  multiplier  is  invoked     inline.  This makes for bigger, but faster code.</p><p>The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running and restore the previous interrupt state when they finish.  This makes them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as in     normal code. `</p><p><b>`-minrt`</b>            Enable  the  use  of  a  minimum  runtime environment - no static initializers or constructors.  This is intended for memory-constrained devices.  The compiler includes special symbols in some            objects that tell the linker and runtime which code fragments are required.</p><p><b>`-mtiny-printf`</b>            Enable reduced code size "printf" and "puts" library functions.  The tiny implementations of these functions are not reentrant, so must be used with caution in multi-threaded applications.</p><p>Support for streams has been removed and the string to be printed will always be sent to stdout via the "write" syscall.  The string is not buffered before it is sent to write.</p><p>This option requires Newlib Nano IO, so GCC must be configured with --enable-newlib-nano-formatted-io.</p><p><b>`-mmax-inline-shift`</b>=            This option takes an integer between 0 and 64 inclusive, and sets the maximum number of inline shift instructions which should be emitted to perform a shift operation  by  a  constant  amount.            When this value needs to be exceeded, an mspabi helper function is used instead.  The default value is 4.</p><p>This only affects cases where a shift by multiple positions cannot be completed with a single instruction (e.g. all shifts >1 on the 430 ISA).</p><p>Shifts of a 32-bit value are at least twice as costly, so the value passed for this option is divided by 2 and the resulting value used instead.</p><p><b>`-mcode-region`</b>=        <b>`-mdata-region`</b>=            These  options  tell  the  compiler  where  to  place  functions and data that do not have one of the "lower", "upper", "either" or "section" attributes.  Possible values are "lower", "upper",            "either" or "any".  The first three behave like the corresponding attribute.  The fourth possible value - "any" - is the default.  It leaves placement entirely up to the linker script and  how            it assigns the standard sections (".text", ".data", etc) to the memory regions.</p><p><b>`-msilicon-errata`</b>=            This option passes on a request to assembler to enable the fixes for the named silicon errata.</p><p><b>`-msilicon-errata-warn`</b>=            This option passes on a request to the assembler to enable warning messages when a silicon errata might need to be applied.</p><p><b>`-mwarn-devices-csv`</b>        <b>`-mno-warn-devices-csv`</b>            Warn if devices.csv is not found or there are problem parsing it (default: on).</p><p>` NDS32 Options</p><p>These options are defined for NDS32 implementations: `</p><p><b>`-mbig-endian`</b>            Generate code in big-endian mode.</p><p><b>`-mlittle-endian`</b>            Generate code in little-endian mode.</p><p><b>`-mreduced-regs`</b>            Use reduced-set registers for register allocation.</p><p><b>`-mfull-regs`</b>            Use full-set registers for register allocation.</p><p><b>`-mcmov`</b>            Generate conditional move instructions.</p><p><b>`-mno-cmov`</b>            Do not generate conditional move instructions.</p><p><b>`-mext-perf`</b>            Generate performance extension instructions.</p><p><b>`-mno-ext-perf`</b>            Do not generate performance extension instructions.</p><p><b>`-mext-perf2`</b>            Generate performance extension 2 instructions.</p><p><b>`-mno-ext-perf2`</b>            Do not generate performance extension 2 instructions.</p><p><b>`-mext-string`</b>            Generate string extension instructions.</p><p><b>`-mno-ext-string`</b>            Do not generate string extension instructions.</p><p><b>`-mv3push`</b>            Generate v3 push25/pop25 instructions.</p><p><b>`-mno-v3push`</b>            Do not generate v3 push25/pop25 instructions.</p><p><b>`-m16-bit`</b>            Generate 16-bit instructions.</p><p><b>`-mno-16-bit`</b>            Do not generate 16-bit instructions.</p><p><b>`-misr-vector-size`</b>=num            Specify the size of each interrupt vector, which must be 4 or 16.</p><p><b>`-mcache-block-size`</b>=num            Specify the size of each cache block, which must be a power of 2 between 4 and 512.</p><p><b>`-march`</b>=arch            Specify the name of the target architecture.</p><p><b>`-mcmodel`</b>=code-model            Set the code model to one of</p><p>small                All the data and read-only data segments must be within 512KB addressing space.

Also when the small data area is used one of the RX's registers (usually "r13") is reserved  for  use            pointing  to  this  area,  so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto the stack instead of being held in            this register.</p><p>Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned to other sections in the output executable.</p><p>The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels (-O2 etc) because of the potentially  detrimental  effects            of  reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the description of the -mpid option for a description            of how the actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.</p><p><b>`-msim`</b>        <b>`-mno-sim`</b>            Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss board-specific runtime.</p><p><b>`-mas100-syntax`</b>        <b>`-mno-as100-syntax`</b>            When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the GAS assembler, but it has some restrictions  so  it  is            not generated by default.</p><p><b>`-mmax-constant-size`</b>=N            Specifies  the  maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be            used in instructions, a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict  the  size  of  constants  that  are  used  in  instructions.            Constants that are too big are instead placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.</p><p>The value N can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default) or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.</p><p><b>`-mrelax`</b>            Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.</p><p><b>`-mint-register`</b>=N            Specify  the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler functions.  The value N can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1 means that register "r13" is reserved for the exclusive use            of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves "r13" and "r12".  A value of 3 reserves "r13", "r12" and "r11", and a value of 4 reserves "r13" through "r10".  A value of  0,  the  default,            does not reserve any registers.</p><p><b>`-msave-acc-in-interrupts`</b>            Specifies  that interrupt handler functions should preserve the accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use the accumulator register, for example because it performs            64-bit multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this makes the interrupt handlers faster.</p><p><b>`-mpid`</b>        <b>`-mno-pid`</b>            Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address held in  a  register.   This  allows  the  location  of            constant  data  to  be  determined  at  run  time without requiring the executable to be relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight memory constraints.  Data that can be            modified is not affected by this option.</p><p>Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually "r13", for the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or larger code, especially in complicated functions.</p><p>The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address depends upon whether the -msmall-data-limit and/or  the  -mint-register  command-line  options  are  enabled.   Starting  with            register  "r13"  and  proceeding downwards, registers are allocated first to satisfy the requirements of -mint-register, then -mpid and finally -msmall-data-limit.  Thus it is possible for the            small data area register to be "r8" if both -mint-register=4 and -mpid are specified on the command line.</p><p>By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored via the -mno-pid command-line option.</p><p><b>`-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts`</b>        <b>`-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts`</b>            Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The default is to issue a  warning  for  each  extra  fast  interrupt            handler found, as the RX only supports one such interrupt.</p><p><b>`-mallow-string-insns`</b>        <b>`-mno-allow-string-insns`</b>            Enables  or  disables  the  use  of the string manipulation instructions "SMOVF", "SCMPU", "SMOVB", "SMOVU", "SUNTIL" "SWHILE" and also the "RMPA" instruction.  These instructions may prefetch            data, which is not safe to do if accessing an I/O register.  (See section 12.2.7 of the RX62N Group User's Manual for more information).</p><p>The default is to allow these instructions, but it is not possible for GCC to reliably detect all circumstances where a string instruction might be used to access an I/O register, so their use            cannot be disabled automatically.  Instead it is reliant upon the programmer to use the -mno-allow-string-insns option if their program accesses I/O space.</p><p>When the instructions are enabled GCC defines the C preprocessor symbol "__RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS__", otherwise it defines the symbol "__RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS__".</p><p><b>`-mjsr`</b>        <b>`-mno-jsr`</b>            Use only (or not only) "JSR" instructions to access functions.  This option can be used when code size exceeds the range of "BSR" instructions.  Note that -mno-jsr does not  mean  to  not  use            "JSR" but instead means that any type of branch may be used.</p><p>` Note:  The  generic  GCC command-line option -ffixed-reg has special significance to the RX port when used with the "interrupt" function attribute.  This attribute indicates a function intended to process fast interrupts.  GCC ensures that it only uses the registers "r10", "r11", "r12" and/or "r13" and only provided that the normal use of the corresponding registers have been restricted via the -ffixed-reg or -mint-register command-line options.</p><p>S/390 and zSeries Options</p><p>These are the -m options defined for the S/390 and zSeries architecture. `</p><p><b>`-mhard-float`</b>        <b>`-msoft-float`</b>            Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and registers for floating-point operations.  When -msoft-float is specified, functions in libgcc.a are used to perform floating-point            operations.  When -mhard-float is specified, the compiler generates IEEE floating-point instructions.

When -mno-hard-dfp is specified, functions in libgcc.a are used  to  perform  decimal-            floating-point operations.  When -mhard-dfp is specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point hardware instructions.

A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand            DWARF call frame information.  When -mno-packed-stack is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when -mpacked-stack is in effect, the backchain is  placed            into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register save area.</p><p>In  general,  code  compiled  with  -mbackchain  is call-compatible with code compiled with -mno-backchain; however, use of the backchain for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole            binary is built with -mbackchain.  Note that the combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and -mhard-float is not supported.  In order to build a linux kernel use -msoft-float.</p><p>The default is to not maintain the backchain.</p><p><b>`-mpacked-stack`</b>        <b>`-mno-packed-stack`</b>            Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When -mno-packed-stack is specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save area only for their  default  purpose;  unused            fields  still  take  up  stack space.  When -mpacked-stack is specified, register save slots are densely packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other purposes,            allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.  However, when -mbackchain is also in effect, the topmost word of the save area is always used to store  the  backchain,  and  the            return address register is always saved two words below the backchain.</p><p>As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with -mpacked-stack is call-compatible with code generated with -mno-packed-stack.  Note that some non-FSF releases of GCC 2.95            for  S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible with code compiled with -mpacked-stack.            Also, note that the combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and -mhard-float is not supported.

This is the default if the target is not "sh*-*-linux*".</p><p>soft-gusa                Generate  GNU/Linux  compatible  gUSA  software  atomic sequences for the atomic built-in functions.  The generated atomic sequences require additional support from the interrupt/exception                handling code of the system and are only suitable for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when the target is "sh*-*-linux*" and SH3* or  SH4*.   When  the                target is SH4A, this option also partially utilizes the hardware atomic instructions "movli.l" and "movco.l" to create more efficient code, unless strict is specified.</p><p>soft-tcb                Generate  software  atomic  sequences  that  use  a  variable  in the thread control block.  This is a variation of the gUSA sequences which can also be used on SH1* and SH2* targets.  The                generated atomic sequences require additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable for single-core systems.  When using  this  model,  the                gbr-offset= parameter has to be specified as well.</p><p>soft-imask                Generate  software  atomic  sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by setting "SR.IMASK = 1111".  This model works only when the program runs in privileged mode and is only suitable                for single-core systems.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not required.  This model is enabled by default when the target  is  "sh*-*-linux*"                and SH1* or SH2*.</p><p>hard-llcs                Generate  hardware  atomic  sequences  using  the  "movli.l"  and  "movco.l"  instructions only.  This is only available on SH4A and is suitable for multi-core systems.  Since the hardware                instructions support only 32 bit atomic variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.  Code compiled with this option is also compatible with  other  software                atomic  model  interrupt/exception  handling  systems  if  executed on an SH4A system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not required for this                model.</p><p>gbr-offset=                This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable in the thread control block structure that should be used by the generated atomic sequences when the soft-tcb  model  has  been                selected.  For other models this parameter is ignored.  The specified value must be an integer multiple of four and in the range 0-1020.</p><p>strict                This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic models, even if they are compatible, and makes the compiler generate atomic sequences of the specified model only.</p><p><b>`-mtas`</b>            Generate  the  "tas.b"  opcode for "__atomic_test_and_set".  Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software configuration this can degrade overall performance due to the operand            cache line flushes that are implied by the "tas.b" instruction.  On multi-core SH4A processors the "tas.b" instruction must be used with caution since it can  result  in  data  corruption  for            certain cache configurations.</p><p><b>`-mprefergot`</b>            When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Table.</p><p><b>`-musermode`</b>        <b>`-mno-usermode`</b>            Don't  allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode code.  Specifying -musermode also implies -mno-inline-ic_invalidate if the inlined code would not work in user mode.  -musermode is            the default when the target is "sh*-*-linux*".  If the target is SH1* or SH2* -musermode has no effect, since there is no user mode.</p><p><b>`-multcost`</b>=number            Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.</p><p><b>`-mdiv`</b>=strategy            Set the division strategy to be used for integer division operations.  strategy can be one of:</p><p>call-div1                Calls a library function that uses the single-step division instruction "div1" to perform the operation.  Division by zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is  the                default except for SH4, SH2A and SHcompact.</p><p>call-fp                Calls  a  library function that performs the operation in double precision floating point.  Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is the default for SHcompact with FPU.                Specifying this for targets that do not have a double precision FPU defaults to "call-div1".</p><p>call-table                Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and the "div1" instruction with case distinction for larger divisors.   Division  by  zero  calculates  an  unspecified                result and does not trap.  This is the default for SH4.  Specifying this for targets that do not have dynamic shift instructions defaults to "call-div1".</p><p>When  a  division  strategy  has  not  been  specified the default strategy is selected based on the current target.  For SH2A the default strategy is to use the "divs" and "divu" instructions            instead of library function calls.</p><p><b>`-maccumulate-outgoing-args`</b>            Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue rather than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also needed for unwinding  to  avoid  changing            the stack frame around conditional code.</p><p><b>`-mdivsi3`</b>_libfunc=name            Set  the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed division to name.  This only affects the name used in the call division strategies, and the compiler still expects the same sets of            input/output/clobbered registers as if this option were not present.</p><p><b>`-mfixed-range`</b>=register-range            Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.  A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling  kernel  code.   A  register            range is specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be specified separated by a comma.</p><p><b>`-mbranch-cost`</b>=num            Assume  num  to  be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers make the compiler try to generate more branch-free code if possible.  If not specified the value is selected depending on            the processor type that is being compiled for.</p><p><b>`-mzdcbranch`</b>        <b>`-mno-zdcbranch`</b>            Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional branch instructions "bt" and "bf" are fast.  If  -mzdcbranch  is  specified,  the  compiler  prefers  zero  displacement  branch  code            sequences.  This is enabled by default when generating code for SH4 and SH4A.  It can be explicitly disabled by specifying -mno-zdcbranch.</p><p><b>`-mcbranch-force-delay-slot`</b>            Force  the  usage  of  delay slots for conditional branches, which stuffs the delay slot with a "nop" if a suitable instruction cannot be found.  By default this option is disabled.  It can be            enabled to work around hardware bugs as found in the original SH7055.</p><p><b>`-mfused-madd`</b>        <b>`-mno-fused-madd`</b>            Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default if hardware floating point is used.   The  machine-            dependent -mfused-madd option is now mapped to the machine-independent -ffp-contract=fast option, and -mno-fused-madd is mapped to -ffp-contract=off.</p><p><b>`-mfsca`</b>        <b>`-mno-fsca`</b>            Allow  or  disallow  the  compiler  to  emit  the "fsca" instruction for sine and cosine approximations.  The option -mfsca must be used in combination with -funsafe-math-optimizations.  It is            enabled by default when generating code for SH4A.  Using -mno-fsca disables sine and cosine approximations even if -funsafe-math-optimizations is in effect.</p><p><b>`-mfsrra`</b>        <b>`-mno-fsrra`</b>            Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the "fsrra" instruction for reciprocal square root approximations.  The option -mfsrra must be used in combination with  -funsafe-math-optimizations  and            <b>`-ffinite-math-only`</b>.   It  is  enabled  by  default  when  generating  code  for  SH4A.   Using -mno-fsrra disables reciprocal square root approximations even if -funsafe-math-optimizations and            <b>`-ffinite-math-only are`</b> in effect.</p><p><b>`-mpretend-cmove`</b>            Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for conditional move instruction patterns.  This can result in faster code on the SH4 processor.</p><p><b>`-mfdpic`</b>            Generate code using the FDPIC ABI.</p><p>` Solaris 2 Options</p><p>These -m options are supported on Solaris 2: `</p><p><b>`-mclear-hwcap`</b>            <b>`-mclear-hwcap tells`</b> the compiler to remove the hardware capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler.  This is only necessary when object files use  ISA  extensions  not  supported  by  the <code> current machine, but check at runtime whether or not to use them. </code></p><p><b>`-mimpure-text`</b>            <b>`-mimpure-text`</b>,  used  in addition to -shared, tells the compiler to not pass -z text to the linker when linking a shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent code into a <code> shared object. </code></p><p><b>`-mimpure-text suppresses`</b> the "relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections" linker error message.  However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the  shared ` object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of using -mimpure-text, you should compile all source code with -fpic or -fPIC.</p><p>`</p><pre><code>These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:
</code></pre><p><b>`-pthreads`</b>            This is a synonym for -pthread.</p><p>` SPARC Options</p><p>These -m options are supported on the SPARC: `</p><p><b>`-mno-app-regs`</b>        <b>`-mapp-regs`</b>            Specify  -mapp-regs to generate output using the global registers 2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.  Like the global register 1, each global register 2 through 4            is then treated as an allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  This is the default.</p><p>To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance loss, specify -mno-app-regs.  You should compile libraries and system software with this option.</p><p><b>`-mflat`</b>        <b>`-mno-flat`</b>            With -mflat, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions and uses a "flat" or single register window model.  This model is compatible with the regular register window model.   The            local registers and the input registers (0--5) are still treated as "call-saved" registers and are saved on the stack as needed.</p><p>With -mno-flat (the default), the compiler generates save/restore instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal operating mode.</p><p><b>`-mfpu`</b>        <b>`-mhard-float`</b>            Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This is the default.</p><p><b>`-mno-fpu`</b>        <b>`-msoft-float`</b>            Generate  output  containing  library  calls  for  floating  point.  Warning: the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C            compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide  suitable  library  functions  for  cross-compilation.   The  embedded            targets sparc-*-aout and sparclite-*-* do provide software floating-point support.</p><p><b>`-msoft-float changes`</b> the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile all of a program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile libgcc.a, the <code> library that comes with GCC, with -msoft-float in order for this to work. </code></p><p><b>`-mhard-quad-float`</b>            Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point instructions.</p><p><b>`-msoft-quad-float`</b>            Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double) floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.</p><p>As  of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have hardware support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions,            and then the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead, this is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the  -msoft-quad-float            option is the default.</p><p><b>`-mno-unaligned-doubles`</b>        <b>`-munaligned-doubles`</b>            Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the default.</p><p>With  -munaligned-doubles,  GCC  assumes  that  doubles  have 8-byte alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have            4-byte alignment.  Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because  it  results  in  a  performance  loss,            especially for floating-point code.</p><p><b>`-muser-mode`</b>        <b>`-mno-user-mode`</b>            Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.  This is relevant only for the "casa" instruction emitted for the LEON3 processor.  This is the default.</p><p><b>`-mfaster-structs`</b>        <b>`-mno-faster-structs`</b>            With  -mfaster-structs, the compiler assumes that structures should have 8-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of "ldd" and "std" instructions for copies in structure assignment, in            place of twice as many "ld" and "st" pairs.  However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC ABI.  Thus, it's intended only  for  use  on  targets  where  the  developer            acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with the rules of the ABI.</p><p><b>`-mstd-struct-return`</b>        <b>`-mno-std-struct-return`</b>            With  -mstd-struct-return, the compiler generates checking code in functions returning structures or unions to detect size mismatches between the two sides of function calls, as per the 32-bit            ABI.</p><p>The default is -mno-std-struct-return.  This option has no effect in 64-bit mode.</p><p><b>`-mlra`</b>        <b>`-mno-lra`</b>            Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is the default for SPARC since GCC 7 so -mno-lra needs to be passed to get old Reload.</p><p><b>`-mcpu`</b>=cpu_type            Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type.  Supported values for cpu_type are v7, cypress, v8, supersparc, hypersparc, leon, leon3,            leon3v7, leon5, sparclite, f930, f934, sparclite86x, sparclet, tsc701, v9, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4, niagara7 and m8.</p><p>Native Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains also support the value native, which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.  -mcpu=native has no effect if GCC does not  recognize            the processor.</p><p>Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that select an architecture and not an implementation.

With -mcpu=cypress, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Cypress CY7C602            chip, as used in the SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is also appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.</p><p>With -mcpu=v8, GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the SPARC architecture.  The only difference from V7  code  is  that  the  compiler  emits  the  integer  multiply  and  integer  divide            instructions  which exist in SPARC-V8 but not in SPARC-V7.  With -mcpu=supersparc, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000            series.</p><p>With -mcpu=sparclite, GCC generates code for the SPARClite variant of the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply, integer divide step and scan ("ffs") instructions which exist  in            SPARClite  but  not  in  SPARC-V7.   With  -mcpu=f930,  the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the original SPARClite, with no FPU.  With -mcpu=f934, the            compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip, which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.</p><p>With -mcpu=sparclet, GCC generates code for the SPARClet variant of the SPARC architecture.  This adds  the  integer  multiply,  multiply/accumulate,  integer  divide  step  and  scan  ("ffs")            instructions which exist in SPARClet but not in SPARC-V7.  With -mcpu=tsc701, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.</p><p>With  -mcpu=v9,  GCC  generates  code  for  the V9 variant of the SPARC architecture.  This adds 64-bit integer and floating-point move instructions, 3 additional floating-point condition code            registers and conditional move instructions.  With -mcpu=ultrasparc, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the  Sun  UltraSPARC  I/II/IIi  chips.   With  -mcpu=ultrasparc3,  the  compiler            additionally  optimizes  it  for  the  Sun  UltraSPARC  III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+  chips.   With  -mcpu=niagara,  the  compiler  additionally  optimizes  it for Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips.  With            <b>`-mcpu`</b>=niagara2, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2  chips.

With            <b>`-mcpu`</b>=niagara4,  the compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips.  With -mcpu=niagara7, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Oracle SPARC M7 chips.  With -mcpu=m8, the <code> compiler additionally optimizes it for Oracle M8 chips. </code></p><p><b>`-mtune`</b>=cpu_type            Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type, but do not set the instruction set or register set that the option -mcpu=cpu_type does.</p><p>The same values for -mcpu=cpu_type can be used for -mtune=cpu_type, but the only useful values are  those  that  select  a  particular  CPU  implementation.   Those  are  cypress,  supersparc,            hypersparc,  leon,  leon3, leon3v7, leon5, f930, f934, sparclite86x, tsc701, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4, niagara7 and m8.

The difference from the V8 ABI is that the global and out registers are considered 64 bits  wide.   This  is  enabled  by  default  on            Solaris in 32-bit mode for all SPARC-V9 processors.</p><p><b>`-mvis`</b>        <b>`-mno-vis`</b>            With -mvis, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions.

While picking a specific cpu-type schedules things appropriately for            that particular chip, the compiler does not generate any code that cannot run on the default machine type unless you use a -march=cpu-type option.   For  example,  if  GCC  is  configured  for            i686-pc-linux-gnu then -mtune=pentium4 generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4 but still runs on i686 machines.</p><p>The choices for cpu-type are the same as for -march.  In addition, -mtune supports 2 extra choices for cpu-type:</p><p>generic                Produce  code  optimized  for  the  most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors.

Since            x86-64  ABI  require  16 byte stack alignment, this is ABI incompatible and intended to be used in controlled environment where stack space is important limitation.  This option leads to wrong            code when functions compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from a standard library) are called with misaligned stack.  In this case, SSE instructions may lead  to  misaligned            memory  access  traps.   In addition, variable arguments are handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects (including x87 long double and __int128), leading to wrong results.

On  Pentium            III, the Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type "__m128" may not work properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.</p><p>To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.  Further, every function must be generated such            that  it  keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack boundary most likely misaligns            the stack.  It is recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.</p><p>This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally increases code size.

Since jump tables are stored in read-only memory, this does not            result in a direct loss of hardening.  But if the jump table index is attacker-controlled, the indirect jump may not be constrained by CET.  This option turns on CET instrumentation to  enable            indirect branch track for switch statements with jump tables which leads to the jump targets reachable via any indirect jumps.</p><p><b>`-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues`</b>            Due to differences in 64-bit ABIs, any Microsoft ABI function that calls a System V ABI function must consider RSI, RDI and XMM6-15 as clobbered.  By default, the code for saving and restoring            these  registers  is  emitted  inline,  resulting in fairly lengthy prologues and epilogues.  Using -mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues emits prologues and epilogues that use stubs in the static portion of            libgcc to perform these saves and restores, thus reducing function size at the cost of a few extra instructions.</p><p><b>`-mtls-dialect`</b>=type            Generate code to access thread-local storage using the gnu or gnu2 conventions.  gnu is the conservative default; gnu2 is more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time requirements that            cannot be satisfied on all systems.</p><p><b>`-mpush-args`</b>        <b>`-mno-push-args`</b>            Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.

This is faster on most modern CPUs  because  of  reduced  dependencies,  improved            scheduling and reduced stack usage when the preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable increase in code size.  This switch implies -mno-push-args.</p><p><b>`-mthreads`</b>            Support  thread-safe  exception  handling  on  MinGW.  Programs that rely on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the -mthreads option.  When compiling, -mthreads            defines -D_MT; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library -lmingwthrd which cleans up per-thread exception-handling data.</p><p><b>`-mms-bitfields`</b>        <b>`-mno-ms-bitfields`</b>            Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native Microsoft Windows compiler.</p><p>If "packed" is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used, it may be that the Microsoft ABI lays out the structure differently than the way GCC normally  does.   Particularly  when  moving            packed data between functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler (either via function call or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access either format.</p><p>This  option  is  enabled by default for Microsoft Windows targets.  This behavior can also be controlled locally by use of variable or type attributes.  For more information, see x86 Variable            Attributes and x86 Type Attributes.</p><p>The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple with the exception of the bit-field packing.  The padding and alignment of members of structures and whether a bit-field can  straddle            a storage-unit boundary are determine by these rules:</p><p>1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they are                declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last member the highest.</p><p>2. Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The alignment requirement                for  all  data  except  structures,  unions,  and  arrays is either the size of the object or the current packing size (specified with either the "aligned" attribute or the "pack" pragma),                whichever is less.  For structures, unions, and arrays, the alignment requirement is the largest alignment requirement of its members.  Every object is allocated an offset so that:</p><p>offset % alignment_requirement == 0</p><p>3. Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte allocation                unit if the integral types are the same size and if the next bit-field fits into the current allocation unit without crossing the boundary imposed by the common alignment  requirements  of                the bit-fields.</p><p>MSVC interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:</p><p>1. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted between two bit-fields that                are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced.</p><p>For example:</p><p>struct                         {                           unsigned long bf_1 : 12;                           unsigned long : 0;                           unsigned long bf_2 : 12;                         } t1;</p><p>The size of "t1" is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-field.  If the zero-length bit-field were removed, "t1"'s size would be 4 bytes.</p><p>2. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted after a bit-field, "foo", and the                alignment of the zero-length bit-field is greater than the member that follows it, "bar", "bar" is aligned as the type of the zero-length bit-field.</p><p>For example:</p><p>struct                         {                           char foo : 4;                           short : 0;                           char bar;                         } t2;</p><p>struct                         {                           char foo : 4;                           short : 0;                           double bar;                         } t3;</p><p>For  "t2",  "bar"  is  placed  at  offset 2, rather than offset 1.  Accordingly, the size of "t2" is 4.  For "t3", the zero-length bit-field does not affect the alignment of "bar" or, as a                result, the size of the structure.</p><p>Taking this into account, it is important to note the following:</p><p>1. If a zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, the type of the                    zero-length bit-field may affect the alignment of the structure as whole. For example, "t2" has a size of 4 bytes, since the zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, and is of                    type short.</p><p>2. Even if a zero-length bit-field is not followed by a normal bit-field, it may                    still affect the alignment of the structure:</p><p>struct                             {                               char foo : 6;                               long : 0;                             } t4;</p><p>Here, "t4" takes up 4 bytes.</p><p>3. Zero-length bit-fields following non-bit-field members are ignored:                        struct                         {                           char foo;                           long : 0;                           char bar;                         } t5;</p><p>Here, "t5" takes up 2 bytes.</p><p><b>`-mno-align-stringops`</b>            Do not align the destination of inlined string operations.

It causes the "UNICODE" preprocessor macro to be predefined, and chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.</p><p><b>`-mwin32`</b>            This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It specifies that the typical Microsoft Windows predefined macros are to be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence the  choice            of runtime library/startup code.</p><p><b>`-mwindows`</b>            This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.

The "CONST16" instruction is currently not a standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, "CONST16" instructions            are always used in place of the standard "L32R" instructions.  The use of "CONST16" is enabled by default only if the "L32R" instruction is not available.</p><p><b>`-mfused-madd`</b>        <b>`-mno-fused-madd`</b>            Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the floating-point option is not  also  enabled.   Disabling            fused  multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be desirable in some cases where            strict IEEE 754-compliant results are required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the intermediate result, thereby producing results with more bits  of  precision  than            specified  by  the  IEEE  standard.   Disabling fused multiply add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and            add/subtract operations.</p><p><b>`-mserialize-volatile`</b>        <b>`-mno-serialize-volatile`</b>            When this option is enabled, GCC  inserts  "MEMW"  instructions  before  "volatile"  memory  references  to  guarantee  sequential  consistency.   The  default  is  -mserialize-volatile.   Use            <b>`-mno-serialize-volatile to`</b> omit the "MEMW" instructions.</p><p><b>`-mforce-no-pic`</b>            For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be position-independent code (PIC), this option disables PIC for compiling kernel code.</p><p><b>`-mtext-section-literals`</b>        <b>`-mno-text-section-literals`</b>            These  options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is -mno-text-section-literals, which places literals in a separate section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool            to be placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it  also  allows  the  linker  to  combine  literal  pools  from  separate  object  files  to  remove  redundant  literals  and  improve  code  size.   With            <b>`-mtext-section-literals`</b>,  the  literals  are  interspersed  in the text section in order to keep them as close as possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly files. <code> Literals for each function are placed right before that function. </code></p><p><b>`-mauto-litpools`</b>        <b>`-mno-auto-litpools`</b>            These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is -mno-auto-litpools, which places literals in a separate section in the output file unless -mtext-section-literals is used.            With -mauto-litpools the literals are interspersed in the text section by the assembler.  Compiler does not produce explicit ".literal" directives and loads literals into registers with "MOVI"            instructions instead of "L32R" to let the assembler do relaxation and place literals as necessary.  This option allows assembler to create several literal pools per function and assemble  very            big functions, which may not be possible with -mtext-section-literals.</p><p><b>`-mtarget-align`</b>        <b>`-mno-target-align`</b>            When  this  option  is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen            density instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density instructions to align a target,  no  widening  is            performed.   The  default  is -mtarget-align.  These options do not affect the treatment of auto-aligned instructions like "LOOP", which the assembler always aligns, either by widening density            instructions or by inserting NOP instructions.</p><p><b>`-mlongcalls`</b>        <b>`-mno-longcalls`</b>            When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target of a direct call is in the  range  allowed  by  the            call  instruction.   This translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct "CALL" instruction into an "L32R" followed            by a "CALLX" instruction.  The default is -mno-longcalls.  This option should be used in programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This  option  is  implemented  in  the            assembler,  not  the  compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC still shows direct call instructions---look at the disassembled object code to see the actual instructions.  Note that the            assembler uses an indirect call for every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.</p><p><b>`-mabi`</b>=name            Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: call0, windowed.  Default ABI is chosen by the Xtensa core configuration.</p><p><b>`-mabi`</b>=call0            When this option is enabled function parameters are passed in registers "a2" through "a7", registers "a12" through "a15" are caller-saved, and register "a15" may be used as  a  frame  pointer.            When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol "__XTENSA_CALL0_ABI__" is defined.</p><p><b>`-mabi`</b>=windowed            When this option is enabled function parameters are passed in registers "a10" through "a15", and called function rotates register window by 8 registers on entry so that its arguments are found            in  registers  "a2"  through  "a7".   Register  "a7"  may  be  used as a frame pointer.  Register window is rotated 8 registers back upon return.  When this version of the ABI is enabled the C            preprocessor symbol "__XTENSA_WINDOWED_ABI__" is defined.</p><p><b>`-mextra-l32r-costs`</b>=n            Specify an extra cost of instruction RAM/ROM access for "L32R" instructions, in clock cycles.  This affects, when optimizing for speed, whether loading  a  constant  from  literal  pool  using            "L32R" or synthesizing the constant from a small one with a couple of arithmetic instructions.  The default value is 0.</p><p>` zSeries Options</p><p>These are listed under `</p><h3 id="environment">Environment</h3><p>` This  section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other aspects of the compilation environment.</p><p>Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as -B, -I and -L.  These take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which in turn  take  precedence  over those specified by the configuration of GCC.</p><p>LANG LC_CTYPE LC_MESSAGES LC_ALL     These  environment  variables  control the way that GCC uses localization information which allows GCC to work with different national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories LC_CTYPE     and LC_MESSAGES if it has been configured to do so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your installation.  A typical value is en_GB.UTF-8 for English in  the  United     Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.</p><p>The  LC_CTYPE  environment variable specifies character classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain     quote and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string end or escape.</p><p>The LC_MESSAGES environment variable specifies the language to use in diagnostic messages.</p><p>If the LC_ALL environment variable is set, it overrides the value of LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES; otherwise, LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES default to the value of the LANG  environment  variable.   If     none of these variables are set, GCC defaults to traditional C English behavior.</p><p>TMPDIR     If  TMPDIR  is  set,  it  specifies  the directory to use for temporary files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of compilation which is to be used as input to the next     stage: for example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler proper.</p><p>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG     Setting GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG is nearly equivalent to passing -fcompare-debug to the compiler driver.  See the documentation of this option for more details.</p><p>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX     If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram,     but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.</p><p>If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is not set, GCC attempts to figure out an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.</p><p>If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.</p><p>The default value of GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is prefix/lib/gcc/ where prefix is the prefix to the installed compiler. In many cases prefix is the value of "prefix" when you ran the configure script.</p><p>Other prefixes specified with -B take precedence over this prefix.</p><p>This prefix is also used for finding files such as crt0.o that are used for linking.</p><p>In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding  the  directories  to  search  for  header  files.   For  each  of  the  standard  directories  whose  name  normally  begins  with     /usr/local/lib/gcc (more precisely, with the value of GCC_INCLUDE_DIR), GCC tries replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.  Thus, with -Bfoo/,     GCC  searches  foo/bar  just  before  it  searches the standard directory /usr/local/lib/bar.  If a standard directory begins with the configured prefix then the value of prefix is replaced by     GCC_EXEC_PREFIX when looking for header files.</p><p>COMPILER_PATH     The value of COMPILER_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories, much like PATH.  GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the subprograms     using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p><p>LIBRARY_PATH     The value of LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories, much like PATH.  When configured as a native compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching  for  special     linker  files,  if  it cannot find them using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.  Linking using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the -l option (but directories specified     with -L come first).</p><p>LANG     This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in which this information is used is to determine the character set  to  be  used  when  character  literals,  string     literals and comments are parsed in C and C++.  When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters, the following values for LANG are recognized:</p><p>C-JIS         Recognize JIS characters.</p><p>C-SJIS         Recognize SJIS characters.</p><p>C-EUCJP         Recognize EUCJP characters.</p><p>If LANG is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the compiler uses "mblen" and "mbtowc" as defined by the default locale to recognize and translate multibyte characters.</p><p>GCC_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT     If  GCC_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT  is  set  to  one  of  the  following  values, then additional text will be emitted to stderr when fix-it hints are emitted.  -fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits and     -fno-diagnostics-parseable-fixits take precedence over this environment variable.</p><p>fixits-v1         Emit parseable fix-it hints, equivalent to -fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits.  In particular, columns are expressed as a count of bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.</p><p>fixits-v2         As "fixits-v1", but columns are expressed as display columns, as per -fdiagnostics-column-unit=display.</p><p>Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the preprocessor.</p><p>CPATH C_INCLUDE_PATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH     Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special character, much like PATH, in which to look for  header  files.   The  special  character,  "PATH_SEPARATOR",  is  target-     dependent and determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.</p><p>CPATH  specifies  a  list of directories to be searched as if specified with -I, but after any paths given with -I options on the command line.  This environment variable is used regardless of     which language is being preprocessed.</p><p>The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories to be searched as if  specified  with  -isystem,  but     after any paths given with -isystem options on the command line.</p><p>In  all  these  variables,  an empty element instructs the compiler to search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the     value of CPATH is ":/special/include", that has the same effect as -I. -I/special/include.</p><p>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT     If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed by the  compiler.   System  header  files  are  ignored  in  the     dependency output.</p><p>The  value of DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the     form file target, in which case the rules are written to file file using target as the target name.</p><p>In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the options -MM and -MF, with an optional -MT switch too.</p><p>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES     This variable is the same as DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see above), except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies -M rather than -MM.  However, the dependence on the main input file     is omitted.</p><p>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH     If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX timestamp to be used in replacement of the current date and time in the "__DATE__" and "__TIME__" macros, so that  the  embedded  timestamps     become reproducible.</p><p>The  value  of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH must be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to the output of     "date +%s" on GNU/Linux and other systems that support the %s extension in the "date" command.</p><p>The value should be a known timestamp such as the last modification time of the source or package and it should be set by the build process. `</p><h3 id="bugs">Bugs</h3><pre><code>For instructions on reporting bugs, see <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-13/README.Bugs>.
