Other system calls result in the termination        of the calling thread, or termination of the entire process with the SIGKILL signal when there is only one thread.  Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching  applications        that may need to execute untrusted byte code, perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.</p><p>Note that although the calling thread can no longer call <a href="./sigprocmask.html">sigprocmask(2)</a>, it can use <a href="./sigreturn.html">sigreturn(2)</a> to block all signals apart from SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.  This means that <a href="./alarm.html">alarm(2)</a> (for example)        is not sufficient for restricting the process's execution time.  Instead, to reliably terminate the process, SIGKILL must be used.  This can be done by using <a href="./timer_create.html">timer_create(2)</a> with SIGEV_SIG‚Äê        NAL and sigev_signo set to SIGKILL, or by using <a href="./setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</a> to set the hard limit for RLIMIT_CPU.</p><p>This operation is available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.</p><p>The value of flags must be 0, and args must be NULL.</p><p>This operation is functionally identical to the call:</p><p>prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT);</p><p>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER        The  system  calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) passed via args.  This argument is a pointer to a struct sock_fprog; it can be designed to filter arbi‚Äê        trary system calls and system call arguments.  If the filter is invalid, seccomp() fails, returning EINVAL in errno.</p><p>If <a href="./fork.html">fork(2)</a> or <a href="./clone.html">clone(2)</a> is allowed by the filter, any child processes will be constrained to the same system call filters as the parent.  If <a href="./execve.html">execve(2)</a> is allowed, the existing  filters  will        be preserved across a call to <a href="./execve.html">execve(2)</a>.</p><p>In  order  to  use  the  SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER  operation,  either  the  calling  thread  must have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in its user namespace, or the thread must already have the        no_new_privs bit set.  If that bit was not already set by an ancestor of this thread, the thread must make the following call:</p><p>prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1);</p><p>Otherwise, the SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER operation fails and returns EACCES in errno.  This requirement ensures that an unprivileged process cannot apply a malicious filter and then invoke  a        set-user-ID  or  other privileged program using <a href="./execve.html">execve(2)</a>, thus potentially compromising that program.  (Such a malicious filter might, for example, cause an attempt to use <a href="./setuid.html">setuid(2)</a> to set        the caller's user IDs to nonzero values to instead return 0 without actually making the system call.  Thus, the program might be tricked into retaining superuser privileges in circumstances        where it is possible to influence it to do dangerous things because it did not actually drop privileges.)</p><p>If <a href="./prctl.html">prctl(2)</a> or seccomp() is allowed by the attached filter, further filters may be added.  This will increase evaluation time, but allows for further reduction of the attack surface  during        execution of a thread.</p><p>The SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER operation is available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER enabled.</p><p>When flags is 0, this operation is functionally identical to the call:</p><p>prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, args);</p><p>The recognized flags are:</p><p>SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG (since Linux 4.14)               All  filter  return  actions  except  SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW  should  be  logged.   An administrator may override this filter flag by preventing specific actions from being logged via the               /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp/actions_logged file.</p><p>SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_NEW_LISTENER (since Linux 5.0)               After successfully installing the filter program, return a new user-space notification file descriptor.  (The close-on-exec flag is set for the file descriptor.)  When the filter re‚Äê               turns SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF a notification will be sent to this file descriptor.</p><p>At most one seccomp filter using the SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_NEW_LISTENER flag can be installed for a thread.</p><p>See <a href="./seccomp_unotify.html">seccomp_unotify(2)</a> for further details.</p><p>SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_SPEC_ALLOW (since Linux 4.17)               Disable Speculative Store Bypass mitigation.</p><p>SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC               When adding a new filter, synchronize all other threads of the calling process to the same seccomp filter tree.  A "filter tree" is the ordered list of filters attached to a  thread.               (Attaching identical filters in separate seccomp() calls results in different filters from this perspective.)</p><p>If any thread cannot synchronize to the same filter tree, the call will not attach the new seccomp filter, and will fail, returning the first thread ID found that cannot synchronize.               Synchronization  will  fail  if  another thread in the same process is in SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT or if it has attached new seccomp filters to itself, diverging from the calling thread's               filter tree.</p><p>SECCOMP_GET_ACTION_AVAIL (since Linux 4.14)        Test to see if an action is supported by the kernel.  This operation is helpful to confirm that the kernel knows of a more recently added filter return action since the  kernel  treats  all        unknown actions as SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS.</p><p>The value of flags must be 0, and args must be a pointer to an unsigned 32-bit filter return action.</p><p>SECCOMP_GET_NOTIF_SIZES (since Linux 5.0)        Get the sizes of the seccomp user-space notification structures.  Since these structures may evolve and grow over time, this command can be used to determine how much memory to allocate for        sending and receiving notifications.</p><p>The value of flags must be 0, and args must be a pointer to a struct seccomp_notif_sizes, which has the following form:</p><p>struct seccomp_notif_sizes            __u16 seccomp_notif;      /* Size of notification structure */            __u16 seccomp_notif_resp; /* Size of response structure */            __u16 seccomp_data;       /* Size of 'struct seccomp_data' */        };</p><p>See <a href="./seccomp_unotify.html">seccomp_unotify(2)</a> for further details. `</p><p>Filters ` When adding filters via SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, args points to a filter program:</p><p>struct sock_fprog {         unsigned short      len;    /* Number of BPF instructions */         struct sock_filter *filter; /* Pointer to array of                                        BPF instructions */     };</p><p>Each program must contain one or more BPF instructions:</p><p>struct sock_filter {            /* Filter block */         __u16 code;                 /* Actual filter code */         __u8  jt;                   /* Jump true */         __u8  jf;                   /* Jump false */         __u32 k;                    /* Generic multiuse field */     };</p><p>When executing the instructions, the BPF program operates on the system call information made available (i.e., use the BPF_ABS addressing mode) as a (read-only) buffer of the following form:</p><p>struct seccomp_data {         int   nr;                   /* System call number */         __u32 arch;                 /* AUDIT_ARCH_* value                                        (see <linux/audit.h>) */         __u64 instruction_pointer;  /* CPU instruction pointer */         __u64 args[6];              /* Up to 6 system call arguments */     };</p><p>Because numbering of system calls varies between architectures and some architectures (e.g., x86-64) allow user-space code to use the calling conventions of multiple architectures (and the conven‚Äê tion being used may vary over the life of a process that uses <a href="./execve.html">execve(2)</a> to execute binaries that employ the different conventions), it is usually necessary to verify the value of the arch field.</p><p>It is strongly recommended to use an allow-list approach whenever possible because such an approach is more robust and simple.  A deny-list will have to be updated whenever a potentially dangerous system  call is added (or a dangerous flag or option if those are deny-listed), and it is often possible to alter the representation of a value without altering its meaning, leading to a deny-list bypass.  See also Caveats below.</p><p>The arch field is not unique for all calling conventions.  The x86-64 ABI and the x32 ABI  both  use  AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64  as  arch,  and  they  run  on  the  same  processors.   Instead,  the  mask __X32_SYSCALL_BIT is used on the system call number to tell the two ABIs apart.</p><p>This means that a policy must either deny all syscalls with __X32_SYSCALL_BIT or it must recognize syscalls with and without __X32_SYSCALL_BIT set.  A list of system calls to be denied based on nr that does not also contain nr values with __X32_SYSCALL_BIT set can be bypassed by a malicious program that sets __X32_SYSCALL_BIT.</p><p>Additionally, kernels prior to Linux 5.4 incorrectly permitted nr in the ranges 512-547 as well as the corresponding non-x32 syscalls ORed with __X32_SYSCALL_BIT.  For example, nr == 521 and nr == (101  | __X32_SYSCALL_BIT) would result in invocations of <a href="./ptrace.html">ptrace(2)</a> with potentially confused x32-vs-x86_64 semantics in the kernel.  Policies intended to work on kernels before Linux 5.4 must en‚Äê sure that they deny or otherwise correctly handle these system calls.  On Linux 5.4 and newer, such system calls will fail with the error ENOSYS, without doing anything.</p><p>The instruction_pointer field provides the address of the machine-language instruction that performed the system call.  This might be useful in conjunction with the use of /proc/pid/maps  to  per‚Äê form checks based on which region (mapping) of the program made the system call.  (Probably, it is wise to lock down the <a href="./mmap.html">mmap(2)</a> and <a href="./mprotect.html">mprotect(2)</a> system calls to prevent the program from subverting such checks.)</p><p>When  checking values from args, keep in mind that arguments are often silently truncated before being processed, but after the seccomp check.  For example, this happens if the i386 ABI is used on an x86-64 kernel: although the kernel will normally not look beyond the 32 lowest bits of the arguments, the values of the full 64-bit registers will be present in the seccomp data.  A  less  sur‚Äê prising example is that if the x86-64 ABI is used to perform a system call that takes an argument of type int, the more-significant half of the argument register is ignored by the system call, but visible in the seccomp data.</p><p>A  seccomp  filter  returns a 32-bit value consisting of two parts: the most significant 16 bits (corresponding to the mask defined by the constant SECCOMP_RET_ACTION_FULL) contain one of the "ac‚Äê tion" values listed below; the least significant 16-bits (defined by the constant SECCOMP_RET_DATA) are "data" to be associated with this return value.</p><p>If multiple filters exist, they are all executed, in reverse order of their addition to the filter tree‚Äîthat is, the most recently installed filter is executed first.  (Note that all filters  will be  called  even  if one of the earlier filters returns SECCOMP_RET_KILL.  This is done to simplify the kernel code and to provide a tiny speed-up in the execution of sets of filters by avoiding a check for this uncommon case.)  The return value for the evaluation of a given system call is the first-seen action value of highest precedence (along with its accompanying data) returned by  exe‚Äê cution of all of the filters.</p><p>In decreasing order of precedence, the action values that may be returned by a seccomp filter are:</p><p>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS (since Linux 4.14)        This  value  results  in immediate termination of the process, with a core dump.  The system call is not executed.  By contrast with SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD below, all threads in the thread        group are terminated.  (For a discussion of thread groups, see the description of the CLONE_THREAD flag in <a href="./clone.html">clone(2)</a>.)</p><p>The process terminates as though killed by a SIGSYS signal.  Even if a signal handler has been registered for SIGSYS, the handler will be ignored in this case and the process always  termi‚Äê        nates.  To a parent process that is waiting on this process (using <a href="./waitpid.html">waitpid(2)</a> or similar), the returned wstatus will indicate that its child was terminated as though by a SIGSYS signal.</p><p>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD (or SECCOMP_RET_KILL)        This value results in immediate termination of the thread that made the system call.

Since Linux 4.11, a single-threaded process will dump core if terminated in this way.</p><p>With the addition of SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS in Linux 4.14, SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD was added as a synonym for SECCOMP_RET_KILL, in order to more clearly distinguish the two actions.</p><p>Note: the use of SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD to kill a single thread in a multithreaded process is likely to leave the process in a permanently inconsistent and possibly corrupt state.</p><p>SECCOMP_RET_TRAP        This value results in the kernel sending a thread-directed SIGSYS signal to the triggering thread.

If there is no attached supervisor (either because the        filter was not installed with the SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_NEW_LISTENER flag or because the file descriptor was closed), the filter returns ENOSYS (similar to what happens when a filter  returns        SECCOMP_RET_TRACE and there is no tracer).  See <a href="./seccomp_unotify.html">seccomp_unotify(2)</a> for further details.</p><p>Note that the supervisor process will not be notified if another filter returns an action value with a precedence greater than SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF.</p><p>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE        When returned, this value will cause the kernel to attempt to notify a <a href="./ptrace.html">ptrace(2)</a>-based tracer prior to executing the system call.  If there is no tracer present, the system call is not exe‚Äê        cuted and returns a failure status with errno set to ENOSYS.</p><p>A  tracer  will  be notified if it requests PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP using ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS).  The tracer will be notified of a PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP and the SECCOMP_RET_DATA portion of        the filter's return value will be available to the tracer via PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.</p><p>The tracer can skip the system call by changing the system call number to -1.  Alternatively, the tracer can change the system call requested by changing the system call to a  valid  system        call number.  If the tracer asks to skip the system call, then the system call will appear to return the value that the tracer puts in the return value register.</p><p>Before  Linux 4.8, the seccomp check will not be run again after the tracer is notified.  (This means that, on older kernels, seccomp-based sandboxes must not allow use of <a href="./ptrace.html">ptrace(2)</a>‚Äîeven of        other sandboxed processes‚Äîwithout extreme care; ptracers can use this mechanism to escape from the seccomp sandbox.)</p><p>Note that a tracer process will not be notified if another filter returns an action value with a precedence greater than SECCOMP_RET_TRACE.</p><p>SECCOMP_RET_LOG (since Linux 4.14)        This value results in the system call being executed after the filter return action is logged.  An administrator may override the logging of this action via the /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp/ac‚Äê        tions_logged file.</p><p>SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW        This value results in the system call being executed.</p><p>If an action value other than one of the above is specified, then the filter action is treated as either SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS (since Linux 4.14) or SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD (in Linux  4.13  and earlier). `</p><p>/proc interfaces ` The files in the directory /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp provide additional seccomp information and configuration:</p><p>actions_avail (since Linux 4.14)        A  read-only  ordered  list of seccomp filter return actions in string form.

Writes to the file do not need to be in ordered form but reads from the file will  be  ordered  in        the same way as the actions_avail file.</p><p>It is important to note that the value of actions_logged does not prevent certain filter return actions from being logged when the audit subsystem is configured to audit a task.  If the ac‚Äê        tion  is  not  found in the actions_logged file, the final decision on whether to audit the action for that task is ultimately left up to the audit subsystem to decide for all filter return        actions other than SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW.</p><p>The "allow" string is not accepted in the actions_logged file as it is not possible to log SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW actions.  Attempting to write "allow" to the file will fail with the error  EIN‚Äê        VAL. `</p><p>Audit logging of seccomp actions <code> Since  Linux  4.14,  the  kernel  provides  the  facility to log the actions returned by seccomp filters in the audit log.  The kernel makes the decision to log an action based on the action type, whether or not the action is present in the actions_logged file, and whether kernel auditing is enabled (e.g., via the kernel boot option audit=1).  The rules are as follows: </code></p><p>‚Ä¢  If the action is SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW, the action is not logged.</p><p>‚Ä¢  Otherwise, if the action is either SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS or SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD, and that action appears in the actions_logged file, the action is logged.</p><p>‚Ä¢  Otherwise, if the filter has requested logging (the SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG flag) and the action appears in the actions_logged file, the action is logged.</p><p>‚Ä¢  Otherwise, if kernel auditing is enabled and the process is being audited (<a href="./autrace.html">autrace(8)</a>), the action is logged.</p><p>‚Ä¢  Otherwise, the action is not logged.</p><h3 id="return-value">Return Value</h3><pre><code>On success, seccomp() returns 0.  On error, if SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC was used, the return value is the ID of the thread that caused the synchronization failure.  (This ID is a kernel thread ID

</code></pre><h3 id="notes">Notes</h3><p>` Rather than hand-coding seccomp filters as shown in the example below, you may prefer to employ the libseccomp library, which provides a front-end for generating seccomp filters.</p><p>The Seccomp field of the /proc/pid/status file provides a method of viewing the seccomp mode of a process; see <a href="./proc.html">proc(5)</a>.</p><p>seccomp() provides a superset of the functionality provided by the <a href="./prctl.html">prctl(2)</a> PR_SET_SECCOMP operation (which does not support flags).</p><p>Since Linux 4.4, the <a href="./ptrace.html">ptrace(2)</a> PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER operation can be used to dump a process's seccomp filters. `</p><p>Architecture support for seccomp BPF <code> Architecture support for seccomp BPF filtering is available on the following architectures: </code></p><p>‚Ä¢  x86-64, i386, x32 (since Linux 3.5)        ‚Ä¢  ARM (since Linux 3.8)        ‚Ä¢  s390 (since Linux 3.8)        ‚Ä¢  MIPS (since Linux 3.16)        ‚Ä¢  ARM-64 (since Linux 3.19)        ‚Ä¢  PowerPC (since Linux 4.3)        ‚Ä¢  Tile (since Linux 4.3)        ‚Ä¢  PA-RISC (since Linux 4.6)</p><p>Caveats <code> There are various subtleties to consider when applying seccomp filters to a program, including the following: </code></p><p>‚Ä¢  Some traditional system calls have user-space implementations in the <a href="./vdso.html">vdso(7)</a> on many architectures.  Notable examples include <a href="./clock_gettime.html">clock_gettime(2)</a>, <a href="./gettimeofday.html">gettimeofday(2)</a>, and <a href="./time.html">time(2)</a>.  On such  architec‚Äê           tures,  seccomp  filtering for these system calls will have no effect.  (However, there are cases where the <a href="./vdso.html">vdso(7)</a> implementations may fall back to invoking the true system call, in which case           seccomp filters would see the system call.)</p><p>‚Ä¢  Seccomp filtering is based on system call numbers.  However, applications typically do not directly invoke system calls, but instead call wrapper functions in the C library which in turn invoke           the system calls.  Consequently, one must be aware of the following:</p><p>‚Ä¢  The glibc wrappers for some traditional system calls may actually employ system calls with different names in the kernel.  For example, the <a href="./exit.html">exit(2)</a>  wrapper  function  actually  employs  the              <a href="./exit_group.html">exit_group(2)</a> system call, and the <a href="./fork.html">fork(2)</a> wrapper function actually calls <a href="./clone.html">clone(2)</a>.</p><p>‚Ä¢  The behavior of wrapper functions may vary across architectures, according to the range of system calls provided on those architectures.  In other words, the same wrapper function may invoke              different system calls on different architectures.</p><p>‚Ä¢  Finally, the behavior of wrapper functions can change across glibc versions.  For example, in older versions, the glibc wrapper function for <a href="./open.html">open(2)</a> invoked the system call of the same name,              but starting in glibc 2.26, the implementation switched to calling <a href="./openat.html">openat(2)</a> on all architectures.</p><p>` The  consequence of the above points is that it may be necessary to filter for a system call other than might be expected.  Various manual pages in Section 2 provide helpful details about the dif‚Äê ferences between wrapper functions and the underlying system calls in subsections entitled C library/kernel differences.</p><p>Furthermore, note that the application of seccomp filters even risks causing bugs in an application, when the filters cause unexpected failures for legitimate operations that the application might need to perform.  Such bugs may not easily be discovered when testing the seccomp filters if the bugs occur in rarely used application code paths. `</p><p>Seccomp-specific BPF details <code> Note the following BPF details specific to seccomp filters: </code></p><p>‚Ä¢  The BPF_H and BPF_B size modifiers are not supported: all operations must load and store (4-byte) words (BPF_W).</p><p>‚Ä¢  To access the contents of the seccomp_data buffer, use the BPF_ABS addressing mode modifier.</p><p>‚Ä¢  The BPF_LEN addressing mode modifier yields an immediate mode operand whose value is the size of the seccomp_data buffer.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><pre><code>The program below accepts four or more arguments.
